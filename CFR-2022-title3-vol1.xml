        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
        <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
        <IPAR>
            <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
            <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>

            <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
        </IPAR>
        <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
        <SIDEHED>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
            <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
        </SIDEHED>
        <SIDEHED>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
            <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
            <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2022), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
        </SIDEHED>
        <SIDEHED>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
            <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
        </SIDEHED>
        <SIDEHED>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>
            <P>
                The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. 
                <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>
                Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

            <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
            <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
            <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

            <P>
                <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E>
                 Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
            </P>
            <P>
                <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E>
                 The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
            </P>
            <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
            <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
            <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
            <P>
                <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E>
                 If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

        <P>This volume of “Title 3—The President” contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President.</P>
        <P>
            The 2021 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
            <E T="03">Federal Register.</E>
             Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.
        </P>
        <P>
            Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the 
            <E T="03">Federal Register</E>
            .
        </P>
        <P>Presidential documents in this volume may be cited “3 CFR, 2021 Comp.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 10132 appearing on page 1 of this book, is “3 CFR, 2021 Comp., p. 1.” Chapter I entries may be cited “3 CFR.” Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is “3 CFR 100.1.”</P>
        <P>This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2022, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.</P>
        <P>
            For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled 
            <E T="03">Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover</E>
             (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the 
            <E T="03">Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders</E>
             (April 13, 1945—January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
            <E T="03">Federal Register</E>
            , such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the 
            <E T="03">Compilation of Presidential Documents</E>
             and the 
            <E T="03">Public Papers of the Presidents</E>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the “Trade Act”) (19 U.S.C. 2253), I issued Proclamation 9694, which imposed a safeguard measure for a period of 3 years plus 1 day comprising both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of large residential washers (washers) provided for in subheadings 8450.11.00 and 8450.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and a TRQ on covered washer parts provided for in subheadings 8450.90.20 and 8450.90.60 of the HTS. I exempted covered imports from Canada and certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) from the application of the measure.</FP>
    <FP>2. On May 16, 2019, I issued Proclamation 9887, which removed Turkey from the list of GSP beneficiary countries, and modified the safeguard measure so that imports from Turkey were no longer excluded. On May 31, 2019, I issued Proclamation 9902, which removed India from the list of GSP beneficiary countries, and modified the safeguard measure so that imports from India were no longer excluded.</FP>
    <FP>3. On August 7, 2019, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) issued its report pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic washers industry (ITC, Large Residential Washers: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-204-013). After taking into account the information provided in the ITC's report and receiving a petition from the representative of the majority of the domestic industry, I determined that the domestic industry had begun to make positive adjustment to import competition but that, despite that adjustment, increased imports of washers at peak times of the year impaired the effectiveness of the action I proclaimed in Proclamation 9694. On January 23, 2020, pursuant to sections 204(b)(1)(B) and 204(b)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2)), I issued Proclamation 9979 to modify the action I took in Proclamation 9694 by allocating on a quarterly basis, within-quota quantities of 1.2 million units during the third year of the action, beginning February 7, 2020.</FP>
    <FP>4. On December 8, 2020, in response to a petition by the representatives of the domestic industry, the ITC issued its determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), finding that the safeguard measure I imposed continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition (ITC, Large Residential Washers: Extension of Action, No. TA-201-076 (Extension)).</FP>
    <FP>
        5. Section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, after receiving an affirmative determination from the ITC pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), to extend 
        <PRTPAGE P="3"/>
        the effective period of any action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act if the President determines that the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury and there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition.
    </FP>
    <FP>6. Pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I have determined that the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic washers industry and there is evidence that the domestic washers industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition, and I have further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9694, as modified, as follows:</FP>
    <P>(a) continuation of the tariff-rate quota on imports of washers described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 2 years, with unchanging within-quota quantities, annual reductions in the rates of duties entered within those quantities in the fourth and fifth years, and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities in the fourth and fifth years; and</P>
    <P>(b) continuation of the tariff-rate quota on imports of covered washer parts described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 2 years, with increasing within-quota quantities and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities in the fourth and fifth years.</P>
    <FP>7. As provided in Proclamation 9694, as modified by Proclamations 9887 and 9902, this safeguard measure shall apply to imports from all countries, except for products of Canada and except as provided in paragraph 8 of this proclamation.</FP>
    <FP>8. As I further provided in Proclamation 9694, as modified by Proclamations 9887 and 9902, this safeguard measure shall not apply to imports of any product described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as listed in subdivision (b)(2) of Note 17 in the Annex to this proclamation, as long as such country's share of total imports of the product, based on imports during a recent representative period, does not exceed 3 percent, provided that imports that are the product of all such countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for not more than 9 percent of total imports of the product. If I determine that a surge in imports of a product described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation of a developing country that is a WTO Member results in imports of that product from that developing country exceeding either of the thresholds described in this paragraph, the safeguard measure shall be modified to apply to such product from such country. In addition, if I determine within 60 days of the date of this proclamation, as a result of consultations between the United States and other WTO Members pursuant to Article 12.3 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, that it is necessary to modify the terms of extension of the safeguard measure, or to terminate the safeguard measure, I shall proclaim the corresponding modification or termination within 40 days of the date of my determination.</FP>
    <FP>
        9. As I further provided in Proclamation 9694, the in-quota quantity in each year under the tariff-rate quota described in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 6 of this proclamation shall be allocated on a quarterly basis as provided for in Proclamation 9979.
        <PRTPAGE P="4"/>

    <FP>10. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Religious Freedom Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Faith inspires hope. Deeply embedded in the heart and soul of our Nation, this transcendent truth has compelled men and women of uncompromising conscience to give glory to God by worshiping both openly and privately, lifting up themselves and others in prayer. On Religious Freedom Day, we pledge to always protect and cherish this fundamental human right.</FP>
    <FP>When the Pilgrims first crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 400 years ago in pursuit of religious freedom, their dedication to this first freedom shaped the character and purpose of our Nation. Later, with the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, their deep desire to practice their religion unfettered from government intrusion was realized. Since then, the United States has set an example for the world in permitting believers to live out their faith in freedom.</FP>
    <FP>Over the past 4 years, my Administration has worked tirelessly to honor the vision of our Founders and defend our proud history of religious liberty. From day one, we have taken action to restore the foundational link between faith and freedom and promote a culture of religious liberty. My Administration has protected the rights of individual religious believers, communities of faith, and faith-based organizations. We have defended religious liberty domestically and around the world. For example, I signed an Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty to ensure that faith-based organizations would not be forced to compromise their religious beliefs as they serve their communities. This includes defending the rights of religious orders to care for the infirm and elderly without being fined out of existence for refusing to facilitate access to services that violate their faith.</FP>
    <FP>We have also protected healthcare providers' rights not to be forced to perform procedures that violate their most deeply-held convictions. Additionally, we have ended the misguided policies of denying access to educational funding to historically black colleges and universities because of their religious character and of denying loan forgiveness to those who perform public services at religious organizations. Throughout this difficult year, we have continued these efforts, cutting red tape to ensure houses of worship and other faith-based organizations could receive Paycheck Protection Program loans on the same grounds and with the same parameters as any other entity. We have also aggressively defended faith communities against overreach by State and local governments that have tried to shut down communal worship. Together, we have honored the sanctity of every life, protected the rights of Americans to follow their conscience, and preserved the historical tradition of religious freedom in our country.</FP>
    <FP>
        While Americans enjoy the blessings of religious liberty, we must never forget others around the world who are denied this unalienable right. Sadly, millions of people across the globe are persecuted and discriminated against for their faith. My Administration has held foreign governments accountable for trampling—in many cases, egregiously so—on religious liberty. In 2019, to shed light on this important issue, I welcomed survivors 
        <PRTPAGE P="9"/>
        of religious persecution from 16 countries in the Oval Office, including Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and made history by standing before the United Nations General Assembly and calling on all nations of the world to stop persecuting people of faith. The United States will never waver in these efforts to expand religious liberty around the world and calls on all nations to respect the rights of its citizens to live according to their beliefs and conscience.
    </FP>
    <FP>On Religious Freedom Day, we honor the vision of our Founding Fathers for a Nation made strong and righteous by a people free to exercise their faith and follow their conscience. As Americans united in unparalleled freedom, we recommit to safeguarding and preserving religious freedom across our land and around the world.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2021, as Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day with events and activities that remind us of our shared heritage of religious liberty and that teach us how to secure this blessing both at home and around the world.</FP>

    <PROC>Proclamation 10135 of January 15, 2021</PROC>
    <EAR>Proc. 10135</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On August 28, 1963, just a century after the Emancipation Proclamation, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led more than 200,000 Americans in a March on Washington in pursuit of jobs and freedom for all people. Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he called on Americans “to sit down together at the table of brotherhood” and meet our promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all. On that historic day, and throughout his life, Dr. King exemplified the quintessential American belief that we will leave a brighter, more prosperous future for our children. Today, we honor and celebrate Dr. King, a giant of the civil rights movement whose nonviolent resistance to the injustices of his era—racial segregation, employment discrimination, and the denial of the right to vote—enlightened our Nation and the world.</FP>
    <FP>
        In the face of tumult and upheaval, Dr. King reminded us to always meet anger with compassion in order to truly “heal the hurts, right the wrongs and change society.” It is with this same spirit of forgiveness that we come together to bind the wounds of past injustice by lifting up one another regardless of race, gender, creed, or religion, and rising to the first principles 
        <PRTPAGE P="10"/>
        enshrined in our founding documents. Indeed, Dr. King described our Constitution and Declaration of Independence as promissory notes left by our Founding Fathers for “every American to fall heir.” His dream, rooted in the American Dream, was that our children might be “judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” This dream, he hoped, would finally let freedom ring for all people.
    </FP>
    <FP>As Dr. King stated in 1961, at the heart of his dream is “equality of opportunity.”  For Dr. King, the march toward civil rights is intertwined with economic empowerment. My Administration has fully embraced this spirit, taking historic action to create jobs and uplift every community across our country and reaching the lowest unemployment rate for Black Americans ever recorded. Through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones that have produced more than $75 billion in new investment in distressed neighborhoods. My Administration has supported our Nation's incredible Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in several ways, including by establishing the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, reauthorizing more than $85 million in funding for them through the FUTURE Act, and allocating $930 million in higher education emergency relief through the CARES Act. As President, I have fully committed to the educational and economic empowerment of minority communities and young people across our Nation—and the progress we have made must continue into the future.</FP>
    <FP>It is clear now more than ever before that we can no longer allow the American Dream to be deferred for Black Americans. However, in this march toward equality, we cannot permit any “creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.” As a student of nonviolence, Dr. King called on us not to “satisfy the thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.” In the national effort to achieve freedom and equality, and in this shared love of country, we must endeavor with all our might to meet the promissory notes endowed to us by our Founding Fathers, as Dr. King fervently wished.</FP>
    <FP>With the same dream, faith, and hope championed by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we recommit to upholding his legacy and meeting our sacred obligation to protect the unalienable rights of all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2021, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. On this day, I encourage all Americans to recommit themselves to Dr. King's dream by engaging in acts of service to others, to their community, and to our Nation.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every human life is a gift to the world. Whether born or unborn, young or old, healthy or sick, every person is made in the holy image of God. The Almighty Creator gives unique talents, beautiful dreams, and a great purpose to every person. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we celebrate the wonder of human existence and renew our resolve to build a culture of life where every person of every age is protected, valued, and cherished.</FP>
    <FP>
        This month, we mark nearly 50 years since the United States Supreme Court's 
        <E T="03">Roe</E>
         v. 
        <E T="03">Wade</E>
         decision. This constitutionally flawed ruling overturned State laws that banned abortion, and has resulted in the loss of more than 50 million innocent lives. But strong mothers, courageous students, and incredible community members and people of faith are leading a powerful movement to awaken America's conscience and restore the belief that every life is worthy of respect, protection, and care. Because of the devotion of countless pro-life pioneers, the call for every person to recognize the sanctity of life is resounding more loudly in America than ever before. Over the last decade, the rate of abortions has steadily decreased, and today, more than three out of every four Americans support restrictions on abortion.
    </FP>
    <FP>Since my first day in office, I have taken historic action to protect innocent lives at home and abroad. I reinstituted and strengthened President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy, issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title Ten taxpayer funding, and took action to protect the conscience rights of doctors, nurses, and organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. My Administration has protected the vital role of faith-based adoption. At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. Just a few months ago, our Nation also joined 32 other countries in signing the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which bolsters global efforts to provide better healthcare to women, protect all human life, and strengthen families.</FP>
    <FP>
        As a Nation, restoring a culture of respect for the sacredness of life is fundamental to solving our country's most pressing problems. When each person is treated as a beloved child of God, individuals can reach their full potential, communities will flourish, and America will be a place of even greater hope and freedom. That is why it was my profound privilege to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life, and it is what motives my actions to improve our Nation's adoption and foster care system, secure more funding for Down syndrome research, and expand health services for single mothers. Over the past 4 years, I have appointed more than 200 Federal judges who apply the Constitution as written, including three Supreme Court Justices—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. I also increased the child tax credit, so that mothers are financially supported as they take on the noble task of raising strong and healthy children. And, recently, I signed an Executive Order on Protecting Vulnerable Newborn and Infant Children, which defends the truth that 
        <PRTPAGE P="12"/>
        every newborn baby has the same rights as all other individuals to receive life-saving care.
    </FP>
    <FP>The United States is a shining example of human rights for the world. However, some in Washington are fighting to keep the United States among a small handful of nations—including North Korea and China—that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. I join with countless others who believe this is morally and fundamentally wrong, and today, I renew my call on the Congress to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion.</FP>
    <FP>Since the beginning, my Administration has been dedicated to lifting up every American, and that starts with protecting the rights of the most vulnerable in our society—the unborn. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we promise to continue speaking out for those who have no voice. We vow to celebrate and support every heroic mother who chooses life. And we resolve to defend the lives of every innocent and unborn child, each of whom can bring unbelievable love, joy, beauty, and grace into our Nation and the entire world.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22, 2021, as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. Today, I call on the Congress to join me in protecting and defending the dignity of every human life, including those not yet born. I call on the American people to continue to care for women in unexpected pregnancies and to support adoption and foster care in a more meaningful way, so every child can have a loving home. And finally, I ask every citizen of this great Nation to listen to the sound of silence caused by a generation lost to us, and then to raise their voices for all affected by abortion, both seen and unseen.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National School Choice Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>As we mark National School Choice Week, my Administration reaffirms its commitment to solving the civil rights issue of our time: educational inequity. We have made substantial progress on this front, but we must continue our efforts to ensure that each and every family in America has the freedom to choose an education that best meets their needs and values.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation currently spends more money per pupil than almost every other industrialized country in the world, yet nearly two-thirds of our youth are not proficient readers, and students across all age groups continue to struggle in math. These failures are largely the result of a one-size-
        <PRTPAGE P="13"/>
        fits-all, industrial-style approach to education. Currently, students are assigned to schools based on where they live, so only those whose families can afford to move to a better-performing school district or can afford private school tuition have a choice in the learning environment that best fits their child's needs. That is fundamentally unfair and unjust. All Americans, no matter their family income, deserve the opportunity to choose the best educational option for them.
    </FP>
    <FP>What is often forgotten is that the failures of this rigid arrangement disproportionately affect racial minorities and distressed communities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. We can no longer allow America's classrooms to be an exception to our Nation's promise of equal opportunity for all. Instead, we must provide equal access to a quality education for every American student, no matter where they reside. In the land of the free, a child's zip code should never determine their future.</FP>
    <FP>That is why, I recently issued an Executive Order on Expanding Educational Opportunity through School Choice that provides in-person options for low-income parents forced to send their children to virtual school during the pandemic. But we must continue this progress. Therefore, I renew my call to the Congress to pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, so we can finally take a giant step towards true liberty for students. This landmark legislation would give more than 1 million children the freedom to attend the school that best fits their needs, and would create more than $5 billion in annual tax credits for those who donate to local scholarship funds, empowering more families to choose the best educational setting for their children.</FP>
    <FP>I also call on the Congress to pass the School Choice Now Act, which will ensure every State can fund elementary and high school scholarship programs, so that students do not lose access to their school of choice because of economic disruptions. As too many school districts across the country refuse to open, these scholarships are needed now more than ever so that families unable to afford private tutors or who work during the day can still provide an education for their children.</FP>
    <FP>Education will always be one of the most important factors in a child's future success. That is why I am fighting to empower all families—of all races, backgrounds, and incomes—with the freedom and the resources they need to make the best decisions for their children. In America, more freedom leads to more opportunity—especially in the classroom. By embracing my Administration's school choice policy, we will make sure that every American student is able to fulfill their God-given potential.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 24 to January 30, 2021, as National School Choice Week.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Terminating Suspensions of Entry Into the United States of Aliens Who Have Been Physically Present in the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of BrazilBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the wake of the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, I took action to suspend and limit the entry of aliens recently present in certain foreign jurisdictions where significant COVID-19 outbreaks had occurred. These jurisdictions included the People's Republic of China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil.</FP>
    <FP>Understanding that the nature of the threat posed by COVID-19 would evolve over time, I directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make recommendations to me regarding whether to continue, modify, or terminate the restrictions that I had previously imposed. On January 12, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an order, effective January 26, 2021, requiring proof of a negative COVID-19 test or documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 for all air passengers arriving from a foreign country to the United States. The Secretary has explained that this action will help to prevent air passengers from the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Federative Republic of Brazil from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 into the United States, as it is the Secretary's understanding that the vast majority of persons entering the United States from these jurisdictions do so by air.</FP>
    <FP>Moreover, the Secretary expects cooperation from those jurisdictions in implementing the testing order. Public health officials in the jurisdictions have a proven record of working with the United States to share accurate and timely COVID-19 testing and trend data, and the United States has active collaborations with the jurisdictions regarding how to make travel safe between our respective countries. As a result of that record, the Secretary reports high confidence that these jurisdictions will cooperate with the United States in the implementation of CDC's January 12, 2021, order and that tests administered there will yield accurate results.</FP>
    <FP>This cooperation stands in stark contrast to the behavior of the governments and state-owned enterprises of the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which repeatedly have failed to cooperate with the United States public health authorities and to share timely, accurate information about the spread of the virus. Those jurisdictions' responses to the pandemic, their lack of transparency, and their lack of cooperation with the United States thus far in combatting the pandemic, cast doubt on their cooperation in implementing CDC's January 12, 2021, order.</FP>
    <FP>
        Accordingly, the Secretary has advised me to remove the restrictions applicable to the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, 
        <PRTPAGE P="15"/>
        and the Federative Republic of Brazil, while leaving in place the restrictions applicable to the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran. I agree with the Secretary that this action is the best way to continue protecting Americans from COVID-19 while enabling travel to resume safely.

    <EAR>Proc. 10139</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to me a report on his investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), I concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9704, by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries. I further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. I also noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum article imports from that country and, if necessary, make corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>
    <FP>3. The United States has an important security relationship with the United Arab Emirates, including our shared commitment to supporting each other in addressing national security concerns in the Middle East, particularly in countering Iran's malign influence there; combatting violent extremism around the world; and maintaining the strong economic ties between our countries.</FP>
    <FP>4. In light of the foregoing, the United States has engaged in discussions with the United Arab Emirates on alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security posed by aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates. On the basis of these discussions, the United States and the United Arab Emirates have now agreed on satisfactory alternative means to address this threat.</FP>
    <FP>
        5. The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the United Arab Emirates on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum imports from the United Arab Emirates, specifically a quota restricting the quantity of aluminum articles imported into the United States from the United Arab Emirates. This measure is expected to allow imports of aluminum from the 
        <PRTPAGE P="17"/>
        United Arab Emirates to remain close to historical levels without meaningful increases, thus making it more likely that domestic capacity utilization will be reasonably commensurate with the target level recommended in the Secretary's report. In my judgment, this measure will provide effective, long-term alternative means to address the contribution of the United Arab Emirates to the threatened impairment to our national security by restraining aluminum article exports from the United Arab Emirates to the United States, limiting export surges by the United Arab Emirates, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and excess aluminum production. In light of this agreement, I have determined that aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude the United Arab Emirates from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704. The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the measure agreed with the United Arab Emirates in addressing our national security needs, and this determination may be revisited, as appropriate.
    </FP>
    <FP>6. In light of my determination to exclude the United Arab Emirates from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704, as amended, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries. I have determined that, in light of the agreed-upon measure with the United Arab Emirates, it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>
    <FP>7. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
    <FP>8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
    <P>(1) Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting “and” before “(g)” and inserting before the period at the end: “, and (h) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 3, 2021, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates.”.</P>
    <P>(2) Clauses 1 and 4 of Proclamation 9776 of August 29, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States) are amended by replacing, in each instance, “subheadings 9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06” with “subheadings 9903.85.05 through 9903.85.08”.</P>
    <P>
        (3) The “Article Description” for subheading 9903.85.01 of the HTSUS is amended by replacing “of Argentina, of Australia, of Canada, of Mexico” 
        <PRTPAGE P="18"/>
        with “of Argentina, of Australia, of Canada, of Mexico, of the United Arab Emirates”.
    </P>
    <P>(4) The superior text to subheading 9903.85.11 of the HTSUS is amended by replacing “of Argentina” with “of Argentina and of the United Arab Emirates”, and the “Article Description” for subheading 9903.85.11 of the HTSUS is amended by replacing “9903.85.05 and 9903.85.06” with “9903.85.05 through 9903.85.08”.</P>
    <P>(5) In order to implement quantitative limitations on aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in Part A of the Annex to this proclamation. For purposes of administering these quantitative limitations, the annual aggregate limits set out in Part B of the Annex to this proclamation shall apply for the period starting with calendar year 2021 and for subsequent years, unless modified or terminated. The quantitative limitations for the United Arab Emirates, which for calendar year 2021 shall take into account all aluminum article imports since January 1, 2021, shall be effective for aluminum articles entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 3, 2021, and shall be implemented by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security as soon as practicable. The Secretary shall monitor the implementation of these quantitative limitations and shall, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, inform the President of any circumstance that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate that an adjustment of the quantitative limitations is necessary.</P>
    <P>(6) The modifications made by clauses 1 through 5 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 3, 2021, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.</P>
    <P>(7) Any imports of aluminum articles from the United Arab Emirates that were admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone under “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 3, 2021, shall not be subject, upon entry for consumption made on or after that date and time, to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty imposed by Proclamation 9704, as amended, and shall be subject to the quantitative limitations established in this proclamation.</P>
    <P>(8) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>I am humbled before God and my fellow Americans to take the sacred oath of President of our beloved country.</FP>
    <FP>Today, we celebrate the triumph of democracy after an election that saw more Americans voting than ever before in our Nation's history, and where the will of the people has been heard and heeded.</FP>
    <FP>We do so at a moment of great peril and promise for our Nation. A once-in-a-century deadly pandemic. A historic and deepening economic crisis. Calls for racial justice some 400 years in the making. A climate crisis with force and fury. We also feel the rise in political extremism and domestic terrorism—unleashed just days ago on our Capitol, the citadel of freedom, but brewing long before—that we must confront and defeat.</FP>
    <FP>Yet in this dire moment, democracy prevailed. On this day, we set our sights on the Nation we know we can and must be. I am honored to do so alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman who has taken the oath to serve in elected national office, and who will not be the last. Together, we know that to overcome the challenges before all of us, to restore the soul of America, requires the beating heart of a democracy: Unity.</FP>
    <FP>With unity, we can save lives and beat this pandemic. We can build our economy back better and include everyone. We can right wrongs and root out systemic racism in our country. We can confront the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity. We can protect our democracy by seeing each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans. For the world to see, with unity we can lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.</FP>
    <FP>As we start the hard work to be done, I pray this moment gives us the strength to rebuild this house of ours upon a rock that can never be washed away. And, as in the Prayer of St. Francis, for where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith, where there is darkness, light.</FP>
    <FP>On this Inauguration Day I swear an oath to be a President for all Americans and ask every American to join me in this cause of democracy. May this be the story that unites us as fellow Americans and as the United States of America.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2021, a National Day of Unity and call upon the people of our Nation to join together and write the next story of our democracy—an American story of decency and dignity, of love and of healing, and of greatness and of goodness.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The United States was built on a foundation of religious freedom and tolerance, a principle enshrined in the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, the previous administration enacted a number of Executive Orders and Presidential Proclamations that prevented certain individuals from entering the United States—first from primarily Muslim countries, and later, from largely African countries. Those actions are a stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.</FP>
    <FP>Beyond contravening our values, these Executive Orders and Proclamations have undermined our national security. They have jeopardized our global network of alliances and partnerships and are a moral blight that has dulled the power of our example the world over. And they have separated loved ones, inflicting pain that will ripple for years to come. They are just plain wrong.</FP>
    <FP>Make no mistake, where there are threats to our Nation, we will address them. Where there are opportunities to strengthen information-sharing with partners, we will pursue them. And when visa applicants request entry to the United States, we will apply a rigorous, individualized vetting system. But we will not turn our backs on our values with discriminatory bans on entry into the United States.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), hereby find that it is in the interests of the United States to revoke Executive Order 13780 of March 6, 2017 (Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States), Proclamation 9645 of September 24, 2017 (Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats), Proclamation 9723 of April 10, 2018 (Maintaining Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats), and Proclamation 9983 of January 31, 2020 (Improving Enhanced Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats).

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        Like every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security. My Administration is committed to ensuring that the United States has a comprehensive and humane immigration system that operates consistently with our Nation's values. In furtherance of that commitment, I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border in Proclamation 9844 of February 15, 2019 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States), was unwarranted. It shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall. I am also directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to construct a southern border wall.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The Federal Government must act swiftly and aggressively to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The national emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security. As of January 20, 2021, the United States had experienced more than 24 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 400,000 COVID-19 deaths. It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to prevent further spread of the disease.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, has determined that the Republic of South Africa is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including a variant strain of the virus known as B.1.351. The World Health Organization 
        <PRTPAGE P="29"/>
        has reported that the Republic of South Africa has over 1,400,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Another variant strain, known as B.1.1.7, is widely circulating and has been traced to the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a third variant strain, which is known as B.1.1.28.1 and may impact the potential for re-infection, has been identified in Brazil. Based on developments with respect to the variants and the continued spread of the disease, CDC has reexamined its policies on international travel and, after reviewing the public health situations within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa, has concluded that continued and further measures are required to protect the public health from travelers entering the United States from those jurisdictions.
    </FP>
    <FP>In my Executive Order of January 21, 2021, entitled “Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel,” I directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services, including through the Director of CDC, and in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation (including through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration) and the Secretary of Homeland Security (including through the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration), to further examine certain current public health precautions for international travel and take additional appropriate regulatory action, to the extent feasible and consistent with CDC guidelines and applicable law.</FP>
    <FP>While that review continues, and given the determination of CDC, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, described above, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of noncitizens of the United States (“noncitizens”) who were physically present within the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), the Republic of Ireland, the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.</FP>

BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        1. Proclamation 10139 of January 19, 2021 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), amended Proclamation 9704 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended, with respect to tariffs on certain imports of aluminum articles proclaimed under section 232 
        <PRTPAGE P="33"/>
        of the Trade Expansion Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). Proclamation 10139 provides that those amendments will not take effect until 12:01 a.m. on February 3, 2021.
    </FP>
    <FP>2. I consider it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to maintain, at this time, the tariff treatment applied to aluminum article imports from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under Proclamation 9704, as amended, as they are currently in effect as of this date. Accordingly, and as provided for in clause (6) of Proclamation 10139, I am terminating the modifications contained in that proclamation before they take effect.</FP>
    <FP>3. Proclamation 9704 applied tariffs to help ensure the economic viability of the domestic aluminum industry—an industry that the Secretary of Commerce had previously identified as essential to our critical industries and national defense. Because robust domestic aluminum production capacity is essential to meet our current and future national security needs, Proclamation 9704 aimed to revive idled aluminum facilities, open closed smelters and mills, preserve necessary skills, and maintain or increase domestic production by reducing United States reliance on foreign producers.</FP>
    <FP>4. In my view, the available evidence indicates that imports from the UAE may still displace domestic production, and thereby threaten to impair our national security. Proclamation 9704 authorized the Secretary of Commerce to grant exclusions from the aluminum tariffs based on specific national security considerations or if specific imported aluminum articles were determined not to be produced sufficiently in the United States, such that the imports would not diminish domestic production. Tellingly, there have been 33 such exclusion requests for aluminum imported from the UAE, covering 587,007 metric tons of articles, and the Secretary of Commerce has denied 32 of those requests, covering 582,007 metric tons. This indicates the large degree of overlap between imports from the UAE and what our domestic industry is capable of producing.</FP>
    <FP>5. Since the tariff on aluminum imports was imposed, such imports substantially decreased, including a 25 percent reduction from the UAE, and domestic aluminum production increased by 22 percent through 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. In light of that history, I believe that maintaining the tariff is likely to be more effective in protecting our national security than the untested quota described in Proclamation 10139.</FP>
    <FP>6. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
    <FP>7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, 
        <PRTPAGE P="34"/>
        and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim that Proclamation 10139, including the Annex, is revoked.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">American Heart Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Tragically, heart disease continues to be a leading cause of death in the United States. It affects Americans of all genders, races, and ethnicities. Yet despite being one of the country's most costly and deadly diseases, it is among the most preventable. During American Heart Month, we recommit to fighting this disease by promoting better health, wellness, and prevention awareness in our communities.</FP>
    <FP>Heart disease can impact anyone, but risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse can increase the likelihood of developing the disease. By adopting a few healthy habits, each of us can reduce our risk. Avoiding tobacco, moderating alcohol consumption, making balanced and nutritious meal choices, and staying active can help prevent or treat conditions that lead to heart disease. Adults with heart conditions are also at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19, which makes it even more important to follow these suggestions.</FP>
    <FP>We have seen the death rate from heart attacks rise dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic because people are delaying or not seeking care after experiencing symptoms. It is important not to ignore early warning signs like chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and sudden dizziness. And the symptoms of a heart attack can be different for men and women, an often-overlooked fact that can impact when people seek care. For more resources and information, follow your health care provider's advice or visit www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to supporting Americans in their efforts to achieve heart health. Under the Affordable Care Act, many insurance plans cover preventive services like blood pressure and obesity screening at no out-of-pocket cost to the patient. By protecting and expanding access to quality, affordable health care, we will work tirelessly to provide all Americans with the care they need to prevent and treat heart disease.</FP>
    <FP>
        We are also committed to closing the racial disparities in cardiovascular health. Despite an overall decline in death rates for heart disease, risk of heart disease death differs by race and ethnicity, and Black Americans continue to have the highest death rate for heart disease. Increased awareness and access to care will help reduce these staggering and unacceptable statistics.
        <PRTPAGE P="35"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>This month, we also honor the health care professionals, researchers, and heart health advocates who save our fellow Americans' lives with their hard work. Every day, they put themselves on the front lines of our fight against heart disease, as well as the scourge of COVID-19.</FP>
    <FP>The First Lady and I encourage everyone to participate in National Wear Red Day on Friday, February 5th. By wearing red, we honor those we have lost to heart disease, and we raise awareness of the steps we can all take to prevent this devastating disease. Combatting heart disease is essential to improving public health in our Nation, and together we will renew our efforts to make all Americans aware of its signs and symptoms. This month, we recommit to building a healthier future for all.</FP>
    <FP>In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as “American Heart Month.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2021 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 5, 2021. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.</FP>

    <FP>This February, during Black History Month, I call on the American people to honor the history and achievements of Black Americans and to reflect on the centuries of struggle that have brought us to this time of reckoning, redemption, and hope.</FP>
    <FP>We have never fully lived up to the founding principles of this Nation—that all people are created equal and have the right to be treated equally throughout their lives. But in the Biden-Harris Administration, we are committed to fulfilling that promise for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>
        I am proud to celebrate Black History Month with an Administration that looks like America—one that reflects the full talents and diversity of the American people and that heralds many firsts, including the first Black Vice President of the United States and the first Black Secretary of Defense, among other firsts in a cabinet that is comprised of more Americans of color than any other in our history.
        <PRTPAGE P="36"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is long past time to confront deep racial inequities and the systemic racism that continue to plague our Nation. A knee to the neck of justice opened the eyes of millions of Americans and launched a summer of protest and stirred the Nation's conscience.</FP>
    <FP>A pandemic has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America, but we see its acute devastation among Black Americans who are dying, losing jobs, and closing businesses at disproportionate rates in the dual crisis of the pandemic and the economy.</FP>
    <FP>We saw how a broad coalition of Americans of every race and background registered and voted—more people than in any other election in our Nation's history—to heal these wounds and unite and move forward as a Nation.</FP>
    <FP>But also less than 1 month after the attack on the Capitol, on our very democracy, by a mob of insurrectionists—of extremists and white supremacists—a bookend of the last 4 years and the hate that marched from the streets of Charlottesville, and that shows we remain in a battle for the soul of America.</FP>
    <FP>We must bring to our work a seriousness of purpose and urgency. That is why we are putting our response to COVID-19 on a war footing and marshalling every resource we have to contain the pandemic, deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who desperately need it, and build back better than ever before.</FP>
    <FP>That is why we are also launching a first-ever whole-government-approach to advancing racial justice and equity across our Administration—in health care, education, housing, our economy, our justice system, and in our electoral process. We do so not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the smart thing to do, benefitting all of us in this Nation.</FP>
    <FP>We do so because the soul of our Nation will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. It is corrosive. It is destructive. It is costly. We are not just morally deprived because of systemic racism, we are also less prosperous, less successful, and less secure as a Nation.</FP>
    <FP>We must change. It will take time. But I firmly believe the Nation is ready to make racial justice and equity part of what we do today, tomorrow, and every day. I urge my fellow Americans to honor the history made by Black Americans and to continue the good and necessary work to perfect our Union for every American.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2021 as National Black History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

    <FP>This February, during National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we stand with those who have known the pain and isolation of an abusive relationship, and we recommit to ending the cycle of teen dating violence that affects too many of our young people.</FP>
    <FP>Together, it's on all of us to raise the national awareness about teen dating violence and promote safe and healthy relationships.</FP>
    <FP>Dating violence transcends gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. It takes many forms, among them physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, bullying, and shaming, which can occur in person or through electronic communication and social media. The spiral of violent dating relationships can lead to depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol use, as well as suicidal thoughts. Victims, especially young women, transgender, and gender nonconforming youth who face higher rates of violence, may suffer lifelong consequences. Many young people do not report the abuse for fear of retribution or unwarranted embarrassment. The pattern of abuse often continues to future relationships.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration encourages all Americans to lead by example by promoting healthy relationships, protecting our teens from abuse, and ensuring they have access to good help and support.</FP>
    <FP>If you or someone you know is involved in an abusive relationship of any kind, immediate and confidential support is available by visiting loveisrespect.org, calling 1-866-331-9474 (TTY: 1-800-787-3224), or texting “loveis” to 22522. For additional information and resources on dating violence, please visit VetoViolence.CDC.gov.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2021 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, and in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy relationships throughout their lives and to prevent and respond to teen dating violence. It's on all of us.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>As of this week during the dark winter of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 500,000 Americans have now died from the virus. That is more Americans who have died in a single year of this pandemic than in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War combined. On this solemn occasion, we reflect on their loss and on their loved ones left behind. We, as a Nation, must remember them so we can begin to heal, to unite, and find purpose as one Nation to defeat this pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>In their memory, the First Lady and I will be joined by the Vice President and the Second Gentleman for a moment of silence at the White House this evening. I ask all Americans to join us as we remember the more than 500,000 of our fellow Americans lost to COVID-19 and to observe a moment of silence at sunset. I also hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset February 26, 2021. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">American Red Cross Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Throughout our country's history, the humanitarian spirit of the American people has shined as a beacon of hope in times of crisis. It is written in our DNA that when hardship strikes, we come together to ensure that no one faces it alone. It is in that spirit that we celebrate American Red Cross Month, a chance to honor all those selfless Americans who step up and lend a hand whenever and wherever people are in need.</FP>
    <FP>For 140 years, the American Red Cross has been synonymous with the prevention and alleviation of human suffering across the globe. Founded by Clara Barton in 1881, the organization's mission lives on in the dedication of Red Cross workers—more than 90 percent of whom are volunteers—and the generosity of the American people in moments of crisis.</FP>
    <FP>We saw unmistakable evidence of that spirit through the challenges of this past year. In 2020, more than 70,000 people became new Red Cross volunteers and stepped up on behalf of those in need—as disaster shelter workers, health workers, blood donor ambassadors, and transportation specialists. And when our country faced a severe blood shortage, the American people rolled up their sleeves, with more than a half-million of our friends and neighbors donating blood with the Red Cross for the first time.</FP>
    <FP>In a year like no other, people made a lifesaving difference. As months of relentless hurricanes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events battered communities, families spent more nights in emergency lodging than in any other year over the past decade—thanks to the hard work and generosity of Red Cross volunteers and partners who provided more than 1.3 million people with overnight stays last year. When the pandemic strained emergency services, Red Cross workers adapted to help fulfill urgent needs. They responded to increased emergency calls from military families, aided hundreds of thousands of home fire survivors, supported international health and hygiene services, and safely provided health and safety courses to essential workers and others to help them manage the COVID-19 threat. In recent days, as harsh winter storms left many Americans without power and water across the South and Midwest, the Red Cross and its partners have worked to help people recover and restore access to safe water.</FP>
    <FP>This month, we renew our commitment to Clara Barton's remarkable vision and join together, as one Nation, to recommit ourselves to a foundational American principle: the duty of care we owe to one another when times get tough. I urge all Americans to take part in that tradition through our own everyday acts of compassion—helping a neighbor, a stranger, or a community in need.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2021 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate

        programs, ceremonies and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Irish-American Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since before the founding of our Nation, Irish immigrants have arrived on our shores with an unyielding spirit of determination that has helped define America's soul and shape our success across generations. Driven by the same dreams that still beckon people the world over to America today, so many crossed the Atlantic with nothing but the hope in their hearts and their faith in the possibility of a better life.</FP>
    <FP>That's what brought the Blewitts from County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth to the United States. For years, they brought Ireland into their homes in America. Working hard. Raising families. Remembering always where they came from. By 1909, my grandparents Ambrose Finnegan and Geraldine Blewitt met and married in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and passed on to my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, a pride and a passion that runs through the bloodstream of all Irish-Americans.</FP>
    <FP>The story of the Irish the world over is one of people who have weathered their fair share of hard times, but have always come out strong on the other side. From often humble beginnings, Irish Americans became the farmers, servants, miners, factory workers, and laborers who fed our Nation, kept our homes, and built our industry and infrastructure. They became the soldiers who won American independence, died to preserve our Union, and fought in every battle since to defend America and its values.</FP>
    <FP>Irish Americans became the firefighters and police officers who have protected us. They are the activists who organized unions to give voice and strength to America's workers. They are the educators who taught generations of American students and the public servants who have answered the call to service in the halls of the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House.</FP>
    <FP>We owe a debt of gratitude to the Irish-American inventors and entrepreneurs who helped define America as the land of opportunity. Irish-American writers pollinated America's literary landscape with their love of language and storytelling, while Irish lyricism has brought poetry, art, music, and dance to nourish our hearts and souls.</FP>
    <FP>
        As I said when I visited Dublin in 2016, our nations have always shared a deep spark—linked in memory and imagination, joined by our histories 
        <PRTPAGE P="42"/>
        and our futures. Everything between us runs deep: literature, poetry, sadness, joy, and, most of all, resilience. Through every trial and tempest, we never stop dreaming.
    </FP>
    <FP>The fabric of modern America is woven through with the green of the Emerald Isle. This month, we celebrate the sacrifices and contributions that generations of Irish Americans have made to build a better America, and we renew the bonds of friendship that will forever tie Ireland and the United States.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2021 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For my family, for the Vice President's family, and for millions of families across our Nation, the fight against cancer is personal. Too many of us know the sinking feeling of shock and devastation when a loved one receives a diagnosis of cancer—too many of us know the unspeakable pain when the fight cannot be won. Each year, colorectal cancer claims more than 50,000 American lives, making it the second leading cause of cancer deaths in our Nation. National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is a chance to bring greater attention to this terrible disease and to offer what families living through it need most: hope.</FP>
    <FP>In this battle, hope and awareness are intertwined. Because the risk of death from colorectal cancer drops dramatically when the cancer is caught early, we can save lives by calling attention to risk factors and increasing routine screening. This month is our chance to improve public understanding of colorectal cancer risk, inform people about screening recommendations, and set our sights on broadening prevention strategies, improving treatments, and finding a cure.</FP>
    <FP>
        Colorectal cancer can afflict anyone, but the risk is higher among some Americans than others. When we lost the trailblazing actor Chadwick Boseman to colon cancer last year after a heroic fight, it served as a reminder that this disease disproportionately impacts communities of color—and is particularly fatal among Black Americans. Age, too, is a factor, as 
        <PRTPAGE P="43"/>
        the majority of cases occur in people over 50 years old. People with increased risk for developing the disease include certain racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, a family history of colorectal cancer, or other risk factors such as tobacco use. For more information on risk factors, you can visit www.cancer.gov.
    </FP>
    <FP>As with so many diseases, the best defense against colorectal cancer is early detection. Symptoms can include blood in the stool; stomach pain, aches, or cramps that do not go away; and weight loss without a known cause. But many cases have no symptoms, especially early in the disease, when colorectal cancer is most curable. A recent Government study estimated that if all 50-year-old adults were screened for colorectal cancer, we could prevent approximately 35,000 deaths. That is why it is so crucial, especially for Americans over 50 or otherwise at increased risk, to receive regular screenings. And although the disease is relatively rare in younger adults, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been rising among this group. No matter your age, every American should take possible colorectal cancer symptoms seriously and bring them to the attention of your health care provider.</FP>
    <FP>I know how hard it is right now to be mindful of preventive care. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted so many parts of our lives, including, for far too many, the routine checkups and screenings that are so vital to guarding against disease. I urge every American to take the precautions they need in order to stay vigilant against cancer—don't delay your recommended screenings, doctor's visits, and treatments. You and your healthcare provider can discuss how to balance the risks and benefits of cancer screening, taking into account medical history, family history, other risk factors, and the time between screenings.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is strongly committed to improving the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and to giving every American access to quality, affordable health coverage. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover a set of preventive services with no out-of-pocket cost. This includes colorectal cancer screening in adults age 50 and older. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration also announced a Special Enrollment Period for the Health Insurance Marketplace now through May 15th, so that millions of uninsured individuals and families can sign up for health coverage and gain these protections. I encourage you to visit www.healthcare.gov to explore your eligibility and get covered.</FP>
    <FP>
        Above all, I want every family facing this fight—and all those that will in the future—to know that there is hope. As President, I am committed to ending cancer as we know it. That mission motivated me every day when I led the Cancer Moonshot Initiative in 2016 to speed up progress toward prevention, treatment, and cures. Thanks to that effort, researchers, oncologists, care providers, philanthropists, data and tech experts, advocates, patients, and survivors have joined forces to double the rate of progress toward a cure for cancer. One particular program, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and follow-up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS), has made strides to improve colorectal cancer screening, follow-up, and referral for care among populations that have low screening rates, including communities of color and rural Americans. You can read 
        <PRTPAGE P="44"/>
        more about this important work by visiting www.cancer.gov and www.cdc.gov/cancer.
    </FP>
    <FP>This month, I encourage all Americans to talk to family and friends about getting screened. If we look out for one another, we can reduce suffering, increase the odds of cancer survival, keep more families whole, and win this fight once and for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2021 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's History Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Each year, Women's History Month offers an important opportunity for us to shine a light on the extraordinary legacy of trailblazing American women and girls who have built, shaped, and improved upon our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Throughout American history, women and girls have made vital contributions, often in the face of discrimination and undue hardship. Courageous women marched for and won the right to vote, campaigned against injustice, shattered countless barriers, and expanded the possibilities of American life. Our history is also replete with examples of the unfailing bravery and grit of women in America, particularly in times of crisis and emergency. Women served our Nation during World War II, led organizing and litigation efforts during the Civil Rights movement, and represented the United States on the global stage in the fight for human rights, peace, and security. Far too often, their heroic efforts and their stories have gone untold—especially the millions of Black women, immigrant women, and others from diverse communities who have strengthened America across every generation.</FP>
    <FP>
        In our current moment of crisis, women continue to lead. From vaccine researchers to public health officials to the countless heroines on the frontlines, women are working around the clock to defeat COVID-19. Women, and particularly women of color, also make up the majority of America's essential workers, including educators and child care providers, grocery store workers, farmworkers, and others who are keeping our families, our communities, and our country afloat. This year has also marked 
        <PRTPAGE P="45"/>
        an historic milestone of women's leadership 232 years in the making, with the inauguration of America's first woman Vice President.
    </FP>
    <FP>As we celebrate the contributions and progress of women and girls, we must also reflect on the extraordinary and unequal burdens they continue to bear today. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated barriers that have held back women—particularly women of color—for generations. Gender and racial disparities in pay continue to fester. A disproportionate share of caregiving continues to fall on the shoulders of women and girls. And now, job losses due to COVID-19 have set women's labor force participation back to its lowest point in more than 30 years—threatening the security and well-being of women and their families and imperiling the economic progress of our entire Nation. The share of mothers who have left the labor force is three times that of fathers; in September 2020 alone, an astonishing 865,000 women dropped out of the American workforce. These trends are even more dire among women of color, with Black and Hispanic women facing disproportionately high rates of unemployment. At the same time, food insecurity has risen dramatically since the pandemic began, particularly in female-headed households with children, as have reports of intimate partner violence.</FP>
    <FP>Since taking office on January 20th, Vice President Kamala Harris and I have made COVID-19 vaccination, relief, and broad-based economic recovery efforts a top priority. Our goal is not to return our economy to where it was before the pandemic struck. Our goal is to build back better—and that means creating a strong and durable foundation for the economic opportunity and security of women in America. Our plans include proposals to provide individual payments and tax credits to put money in the hands of families in need; increase housing and food assistance as well as unemployment insurance; lower health costs and expand access to coverage; increase support for and access to child care; and expand existing paid leave policies. We are also committed to making further progress on what, for me, has been a lifelong cause: reducing gender-based violence, and advancing the safety, economic stability, and well-being of survivors.</FP>
    <FP>Sixty years ago, when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt confronted President John F. Kennedy about the lack of women in Government, he appointed her as head of a new commission to address the status of women in America and take on discrimination in all of its forms. We have made significant progress in the United States, thanks to the persistence and tireless work of countless women. I am proud that the White House Gender Policy Council will build on those efforts by putting a laser focus on the needs and contributions of women and girls, and ensuring a Government-wide focus on gender equity. Our Administration is also committed to ensuring that women are well-represented at all levels in the executive branch: already, we have selected a record number of women who represent the diversity of America to serve in Cabinet-level positions.</FP>
    <FP>
        During Women's History Month, let us honor the accomplished and visionary women who have helped build our country, including those whose contributions have not been adequately recognized and celebrated. And let us pay tribute to the trailblazers from the recent and distant past for daring to envision a future for which no past precedent existed, and for building a Nation of endless possibilities for all of its women and girls.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>American families are grappling with the devastating challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis with courage and resilience every day. In this moment of crisis, the last thing any of us should have to contend with are predators in the consumer marketplace seeking to take advantage of us, exploit our personal data, or invade our digital privacy.</FP>
    <FP>Unfortunately, the pandemic has brought a wave of fraud in its wake, with scam artists serving up fake websites and advertisements targeting desperate Americans in search of personal protective equipment. Scammers also saw the distribution of stimulus payments as fertile ground for fraud, offering vulnerable people false promises of help to get their payments more quickly. My Administration has zero tolerance for these and other criminals who take Americans' hard-earned dollars or abuse their personal information.</FP>
    <FP>As Americans rely more and more on digital products—from virtual communication tools helping us stay connected through the pandemic, to apps and smart appliances that bring greater convenience to our lives—our commitment to consumer protection must keep pace with these incredible innovations. Just because we increasingly depend on technology to work, shop, go to school, and see our loved ones doesn't mean that we should sacrifice our safety or privacy.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration will make it a priority to ensure that companies providing these and other services honor consumer expectations regarding their privacy and their data. We will pursue fraudulent actors aggressively, and work to raise the bar on digital security standards as new innovations are introduced. We also recognize the important role that savvy consumers play in keeping the marketplace honest. My Administration will make sure that Americans in every community have access to the educational resources they need to make informed choices online—including resources to help them protect their privacy and recognize, avoid, and report fraudulent schemes.
        <PRTPAGE P="47"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>As millions of Americans face continued hardship from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must also prevent abuses that can result in individuals and families losing their homes. My Administration has taken decisive action to help keep people in their homes, and I encourage Americans to visit www.consumerfinance.gov/housing for up-to-date information on their relief options, protections, and key deadlines. As Federal agencies continue working to implement housing assistance for American families, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers this website as a one-stop shop for both homeowners and renters to learn about programs and resources that can help them stay in their homes by reducing the risk of eviction and foreclosure.</FP>
    <FP>The Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, our Nation's consumer protection agencies, in coordination with law enforcement across the country, fight predatory practices and privacy violations day in and day out, with investigations, law enforcement actions, and free, actionable, plain-language consumer education resources. National Consumer Protection Week brings together public and private sector organizations that work to educate and protect the American people from marketplace threats. This week, and all year long, my Administration is dedicated to making sure that every American understands their rights and has access to information that can help protect themselves and their communities. To learn more about these resources, visit www.consumer.ftc.gov. To learn how to get involved with National Consumer Protection Week, visit www.ftc.gov/ncpw.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        I have always believed that America's children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft—the more we do today to spark their curiosity, their confidence, and their imaginations, the stronger our country will be tomorrow. The key to developing young learners into engaged, active, and innovative thinkers is instilling in them a love of reading at an early age. Reading is the gateway to countless skills and possibilities—it sets children on the path to a lifetime of discovery. On this Read Across America Day, 
        <PRTPAGE P="48"/>
        we celebrate the parents, educators, librarians, and other champions of reading who help launch our Nation's children on that critical path.
    </FP>
    <FP>Once a passion for reading takes hold in a young person, the benefits extend far beyond the classroom. Reading broadens our perspective, introduces us to new worlds, cultures, and languages, and cultivates our sense of empathy and understanding of other people's experiences and views. Reading informs us, empowers us, and teaches us the lessons of history. It helps us make sense of the world as it is—and inspires us to dream of what it could be. Studies also show that reading improves our memory, helps us become better problem solvers, and even reduces the chance of developing cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's down the road. And with the right book in hand, reading can nourish not only our minds, but our souls.</FP>
    <FP>The First Lady often observes that “any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.” She is absolutely correct. Literacy is essential to finding a good-paying job, advancing in your career, and carving out your place in the middle class. Reading proficiency is what makes us a Nation of innovators and entrepreneurs—a Nation capable of building and growing a dynamic 21st century economy. Reading comprehension is also what allows us to discern fact from fiction—a critical skill at all times, and especially so in the midst of a global pandemic, when the health and safety of our loved ones could very well depend on determining the veracity of what we read.</FP>
    <FP>According to Department of Education estimates, more than half of United States adults (54 percent) between 16- and 74-years of age lack proficiency in literacy, reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level. Illiteracy incurs a massive economic toll on our economy, and keeps not just individuals, but our entire Nation, from reaching our full potential. By every calculation, reading matters to our shared quality of life.</FP>
    <FP>For countless Americans, the path to literacy begins with story time in their school classroom. That is one of many reasons why my Administration is providing support to States and communities to help them create the conditions for students to return to safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible. We must ensure that all of our children receive the high-quality instruction and essential classroom time they need to learn and grow. It is a national imperative that we minimize the learning loss caused by the pandemic—and address the disproportionate impact that lost time imposes on our most vulnerable students and families.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2021, as Read Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Poison Prevention Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Sixty years ago, the Congress established National Poison Prevention Week to remind all Americans to stay vigilant and protect our families from the often hidden threat of poisoning. Never has that reminder been more timely than this year—9 out of 10 poisonings occur inside the home, and with families spending more time indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, children and isolated seniors are at an increased risk of accidental poisoning that could result in injury or death.</FP>
    <FP>
        Young children are particularly vulnerable to accidental poisoning because—as every parent knows—children tend to explore objects with their hands and mouths. That's especially true when it comes to products with floral or fruity aromas, or those that come in colorful packaging. Hand sanitizer, household cleaning products, laundry packets, medications, coin cell batteries, and liquid nicotine are among the most commonly ingested products; these and similar items should be stored in child-resistant packaging and kept out of sight and out of reach of children. Medications should be secured and, if possible, locked away. And unfinished or unused medicine 
        <PRTPAGE P="50"/>
        should be properly discarded—many pharmacies and police departments have disposal kiosks for just that purpose.
    </FP>
    <FP>In 2019, approximately 67,500 of our Nation's children under the age of 5 had to visit the emergency room due to unintended poisoning. About 85 percent of these incidents occurred in the home, most often because they ingested blood pressure medications, acetaminophen, bleach, ibuprofen, antidepressants, attention deficit disorder medications, or laundry packets. Elderly Americans are also at risk of mistaking medications and ingesting household products; for seniors who are isolated due to the pandemic, it is particularly important to secure and clearly label medications and poisonous substances.</FP>
    <FP>Poison control centers are a vital component of our Nation's response to poisonings. Centers across the United States operate around the clock and respond to approximately three million calls every year from the public, as well as from health care providers, 911 public-safety access points, health departments, law enforcement, first responders, and other safety agencies. They represent our first line of defense in many cases, including when it comes to the opioid epidemic that continues to devastate so many of our families and communities.</FP>
    <FP>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths have increased significantly in the past several years. Opioids are the main driver for this increase, killing nearly 47,000 people in the United States in 2018. Two out of three opioid-involved overdose deaths involve synethic opioids, including illegally manufactured fentanyl. When used in combination with other drugs, with or without the user's knowledge, it can be poisonous and deadly.</FP>
    <FP>But even legal substances, like liquid nicotine, can pose a deadly risk. Ingestion of small amounts of liquid nicotine can be extremely hazardous and even deadly to children, which is why the Consumer Product Safety Commission has warned vape shops and other retailers that selling liquid nicotine without proper packaging violates Federal law. To avoid potential poisonings, always store liquid nicotine in its child-resistant packaging, tightly seal the container after each use, and keep it locked or stored away from children.</FP>
    <FP>If you believe someone has been poisoned, immediately call the Poison Control Help line at 800-222-1222. For more information, go to poisonhelp.org.</FP>
    <FP>To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, on September 26, 1961, the United States Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as “National Poison Prevention Week.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 21 through March 27, 2021, to be National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard their families from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines often found in our homes, and to raise awareness of these dangers to prevent accidental injuries and deaths.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Agriculture Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On National Agriculture Day, we recognize the unique and irreplaceable value that farmers, ranchers, foresters, farmworkers, and other agricultural stewards have contributed to our Nation's past and present. America's agriculture sector safeguards our Nation's lands through sustainable management; ensures the health and safety of animals, plants, and people; provides a safe and abundant food supply; and facilitates opportunities for prosperity and economic development in rural America.</FP>
    <FP>Over the last year, workers and other leaders across the agriculture sector have stepped up to ensure a stable food supply in the face of incredible challenges prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Farmworkers, who have always been vital to our food system, continued to grow, harvest, and package food, often at great personal risk. Local farmers helped to meet their communities' needs by selling food directly to consumers. Small meat processors increased their capacity as demand for their services skyrocketed. Restaurants found creative ways to bring food to members of their communities. Grocers and grocery workers also navigated new models, such as curbside pickup and online sales.</FP>
    <FP>These collective efforts helped get food to the millions of adults and children in America experiencing nutrition insecurity. Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; school meals; and others focused on eliminating nutrition insecurity play an integral role in making sure that every family has enough food on the table.</FP>
    <FP>As we overcome the pandemic and build back better, we will advance an agriculture sector that works for everyone. When I took office, I made a commitment alongside Vice President Kamala Harris to put racial equity at the forefront of our Administration's priorities. For generations, Black, Indigenous, and other farmers of color have contributed to sustaining this Nation. They fed their communities, gave the country new food products, and nourished communities with rich food traditions. Yet for generations they have faced the harmful effects of systemic racism. On this National Agriculture Day, I remain determined to address racial inequity and create an equitable space for all to participate in the great American enterprise of agriculture.</FP>
    <FP>
        I also made a commitment to tackle the climate crisis. Farmers, ranchers, and foresters play a critical role in combating climate change. From sequestering carbon in the soil to producing renewable energy on farms, we will continue to innovate and create new revenue streams for farmers and ranchers while building a resilient agriculture sector.

    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>If the isolation and loss of the last year has taught us anything, it is just how much we need each other, how intertwined our lives are, and how deeply we crave conversation, connection, and community. We are at our best when we work together and help our neighbors, whether down the road or around the world.</FP>
    <FP>This lesson is at the heart of Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., when we celebrate the role models, mentors, and leaders who devote themselves to the progress and success of each new generation, to reinforcing our common bonds, and to lifting up our highest ideals. Today, we mark the legacy of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, a guiding light of the international Chabad-Lubavitch movement and a testament to the power and resilience of the human spirit. A witness to some of the 20th century's darkest events and greatest tragedies, he devoted his life to bringing healing by advancing justice, compassion, inclusivity, and fellowship worldwide. A tireless advocate for students of all ages, he sought to foster exchange, understanding, and unity among all people.</FP>
    <FP>The global pandemic has brought some measure of struggle and sorrow to each of us, and amidst the larger tragedies—the tragic loss of so many lives and livelihoods—we have also missed the many small but meaningful moments that contribute to our shared humanity: a hug or handshake, a smile or a meal, the dignity of daily work, and the simple routines that give our lives greater structure and purpose. We have realized that one of the greatest gifts our schools give to our students and educators is time spent with each other—the daily opportunities to learn and grow together, face to face. There is no substitute for this experience and the wonder and wisdom it brings.</FP>
    <FP>
        The American Rescue Plan will help to restore these connections. The plan dedicates the resources we need to defeat the pandemic and return to our lives and loved ones, and provides direct relief to families, small businesses, and communities. It also includes 130 billion dollars to help 
        <PRTPAGE P="53"/>
        schools in every community reopen safely and soon, so that our children can return to the invaluable interactions with friends, teachers, and school staff that add up to so much more than the sum of their parts.
    </FP>
    <FP>On this Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., let us recommit ourselves to building an America that is more just, equal, unified, and prosperous. Let us leave our children a nation and a world that is better than the one we inherited—and, in the spirit of history's greatest teachers, let us help all of our students to love learning; seek lives of dignity, decency, and respect; and work together for the common good.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 24, 2021, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Exactly 200 years ago, inspired by the same ideals of liberty, self-governance, and passionate belief in democracy that sparked the American Revolution, the people of Greece declared their independence. Today, the people of the United States join the Greek people in commemorating the creation of the modern Greek state—and celebrating two centuries of enduring friendship between our nations.</FP>
    <FP>On Greek Independence Day, we celebrate the history and values that unite the United States of America and the Hellenic Republic. Our Founding Fathers drew inspiration from ancient Greece's example as they framed our Constitution and formed the world's first modern democracy. A few decades later, American Philhellenes championed Greece's quest for independence, forging a close connection between our peoples that has flourished over the ensuing years.</FP>
    <FP>During the course of my career, I have had the privilege to work closely with many Greek Prime Ministers. I have been blessed by lifelong friendships in the Greek-American community, including with a great leader whom we recently lost, Senator Paul Sarbanes. From a young age, I have admired the courage, decency, and honor that defines the Greek community—the unwillingness to bend or bow in the face of injustice, or to accept abuses of power.</FP>
    <FP>Today, Greece is a crucial NATO ally and friend of the United States, and a leader for peace and prosperity in the Eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Western Balkans regions. The United States welcomes Greece's commitment to hosting the United States Naval Support Activity at Souda Bay, Crete, and United States rotational forces elsewhere in Greece. Through our ongoing Strategic Dialogue, we have advanced our relationship in nearly every respect. We have accelerated progress on making the region a safer place, and we have increased trade and investment that brings jobs and prosperity to the people of our nations and to the world.</FP>
    <FP>Our strong and historic relationship continues to grow in depth and breadth. We have diversified the region's energy sources, enhanced educational and cultural exchanges, partnered on counterterrorism, and reconfirmed our commitment to the rule of law. As we honor our shared history and accomplishments, we believe the common values that have guided our societies for 200 years will help us accomplish even more together in the years to come.</FP>
    <FP>
        This bicentennial reminds Americans and Greeks alike of the enduring strength of the principles that sparked our respective revolutions and the values that uphold our democracies. We congratulate Hellenic-American organizations, the estimated three million Americans of Greek descent, and the Greek people on a year of commemorations and events celebrating this historic milestone in both the United States and Greece.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Equal Pay Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Equal Pay Day is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance equity and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This day is a symbolic representation of how far into this year women must work to catch up to what men made in the previous year. Women working full-time, year-round are typically paid just 82 cents for every dollar paid to men. It is a day that calls us to action—to renew our commitment to the principles of equity and equal opportunity that define who we are as Americans.</FP>
    <FP>Women lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of thousands over a lifetime, because of the gender and racial wage gap. In 2019, the typical woman who worked full time took home just 82 percent of the typical man's pay. The disparities are even greater for Black, Native American, and Hispanic women, who earned 63 percent, 60 percent, and 55 percent of white men's wages, respectively. While Asian American women make 87 percent of what white men make, the gap for Asian women varies significantly depending on subpopulation, with some Asian women—for example, Cambodian and Vietnamese women—earning among the lowest wages. Those gaps mean we will not be marking Latinas' Equal Pay Day until October—because it takes that long for the average Latina to earn what the average white man made in the previous year. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have seen women, particularly women of color, disproportionately working on the frontlines, caring for our loved ones, and working to combat the virus—but they continue to earn less than their male counterparts.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Biden-Harris Administration believes that ensuring equal pay is essential to advancing America's values of fairness and equity as well as our economic strength here at home and our competitiveness abroad. The burdens and job losses women sustained this year have erased more than 30 years 
        <PRTPAGE P="56"/>
        of progress they have made in the labor force. Due in large part to the impact of the pandemic, there are 4.2 million fewer women working now than there were in February 2020—and millions more women have had to reduce their hours, often in response to caregiving demands that we know fall disproportionately on women. America's economic recovery depends on us addressing the barriers that have hampered women from fully participating in the labor force, resulting in gender income and wealth gaps that have been magnified and exacerbated by COVID-19.
    </FP>
    <FP>We must begin by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will take important steps towards the goal of ending pay discrimination. For instance, it will ban employers from seeking salary history—removing a common false justification for under-paying women and people of color—and it will hold employers accountable who engage in systemic discrimination. The bill will also work to ensure transparency and reporting of disparities in wages, because the problem will never be fixed if workers are kept in the dark about the fact that they are not being paid fairly. Relying on individuals to uncover unfair pay practices on their own will not get the job done; when pay data is available, workers can better advocate for fair pay and employers can fix inequities.</FP>
    <FP>We must also provide paid family and medical leave, make schedules more predictable and childcare more affordable, and build pipelines for training that enable women to access higher-paying jobs. This commitment also means increasing pay for childcare workers, preschool teachers, home health aides, and others in the care economy—and taking additional steps to increase wages for American workers, such as raising the minimum wage and empowering workers to organize and collectively bargain, both of which are important to reducing the wage gap for women.</FP>
    <FP>Vice President Harris and I are committed to building back better: for low-wage workers, for working families, and for all women. There is still significant work to be done to make sure our daughters receive the same rights and opportunities as our sons, and that work is critical to ensuring that every American is given a fair shot to get ahead in this country. Today, on Equal Pay Day, we recognize the role that equal pay plays in building back better for everyone.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 24, 2021, as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In his time, César E. Chávez witnessed a booming economy that served those at the top, but left millions of hardworking Americans behind—and he earned an enduring place in history by standing strong for the rights and dignity of the working people who built and sustained our Nation. Today, on what would have been his 94th birthday, we summon his courage and moral clarity to guide us as we face the ongoing challenges of a pandemic, a deeply unequal economic crisis, and a long overdue national reckoning on racial and economic justice. As we work to recover and rebuild an economy that rewards hard work and brings everyone along—including the immigrants and farm workers he championed, as well as the essential workers carrying our Nation on their backs today—we have no finer role model than César Chávez.</FP>
    <FP>His legacy as the founder, along with Dolores Huerta, of the United Farm Workers of America, reminds us of the central place that organizing and collective bargaining holds in advancing the dignity and wellbeing of working Americans. It's a reminder that the power of workers coming together to bargain for a better deal is what built the American middle class and made possible the American dream. Chávez taught us: “Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.” That most American of sentiments is as resonant today as it has ever been, as we seek to build back our Nation in a way that brings every single one of us along.</FP>
    <FP>He fasted. He marched. He organized. He stayed true to his convictions, and brought hope to millions for whom hope had often seemed too far away. To him, “La Causa” meant elevating our common humanity to the center of an agenda for progress. And that elevation meant organizing for safe and healthy workplaces, a living wage, protections against sickness and disability, time with family, and so much else that we continue to prize and fight for today.</FP>
    <FP>I keep that lesson in my heart every day—and I was proud to place a bust of César Chávez in the Oval Office, so that no one who enters that historic room may forget the powerful truths his farm worker hands imparted. On César Chávez Day, let us recommit ourselves to the duty we have in service to one another to work toward equity and justice across our communities.</FP>

Transgender Day of Visibility recognizes the generations of struggle, activism, and courage that have brought our country closer to full equality for transgender and gender non-binary people in the United States and around the world. Their trailblazing work has given countless transgender individuals the bravery to live openly and authentically. This hard-fought progress is also shaping an increasingly accepting world in which peers at school, teammates and coaches on the playing field, colleagues at work, and allies in every corner of society are standing in support and solidarity with the transgender community.</FP>
    <FP>In spite of our progress in advancing civil rights for LGBTQ+ Americans, too many transgender people—adults and youth alike—still face systemic barriers to freedom and equality. Transgender Americans of all ages face high rates of violence, harassment, and discrimination. Nearly one in three transgender Americans have experienced homelessness at some point in life. Transgender Americans continue to face discrimination in employment, housing, health care, and public accommodations. The crisis of violence against transgender women, especially transgender women of color, is a stain on our Nation's conscience.</FP>
    <FP>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to fulfilling the promise of America for all Americans by stamping out discrimination and delivering freedom and equality for all.</FP>
    <FP>To ensure that the Federal Government protects the civil rights of transgender Americans, I signed, on my first day in office, an Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. Today, we are proud to celebrate Transgender Day of Visibility alongside barrier-breaking public servants, including the first openly transgender American to be confirmed by the United States Senate, and alongside patriotic transgender service members, who are once again able to proudly and openly serve their country. We also celebrate together with transgender Americans across the country who will benefit from our efforts to stop discrimination and advance inclusion for transgender Americans in housing, in credit and lending services, in the care we provide for our veterans, and more.</FP>
    <FP>
        To more fully protect the civil rights of transgender Americans, we must pass the Equality Act and provide long overdue Federal civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Equality Act will deliver legal protections for LGBTQ+ Americans in our housing, 
        <PRTPAGE P="59"/>
        education, public services, and lending systems. It will serve as a lasting legacy to the bravery and fortitude of the LGBTQ+ movement.
    </FP>
    <FP>Vice President Harris and I affirm that transgender Americans make our Nation more prosperous, vibrant, and strong. I urge my fellow Americans to join us in uplifting the worth and dignity of every transgender person.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2021, as Transgender Day of Visibility. I call upon all Americans to join in the fight for full equality for all transgender people.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Month of the Military Child, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>April marks the Month of the Military Child, when our Nation pays tribute to the resilience and tenacity of our military children; over 2 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve and children of veterans who did not make the choice to serve, but live each day supporting their brave parents. These young people live out the words of the poet John Milton, “they also serve who only stand and wait.” We see their service and thank them for it.</FP>
    <FP>From a young age, children of service members sometimes endure long separations from their parents and shoulder the burdens of service. They spend holidays and milestones apart from those they love the most, or celebrate with only a short phone call or virtual chat from a faraway parent. This is something the First Lady and I have witnessed in our own lives, as our grandchildren experienced their father's deployment to Iraq.</FP>
    <FP>Military children change schools up to nine times between the start of kindergarten and high school graduation. With each move, they grapple with difficult goodbyes and the challenge of making new friends. Although life in a military family can include exploring new places and exposure to other cultures and customs, it can also bring frustration and loneliness. During the Month of the Military Child, we show our appreciation for the commitment and service of military children in shouldering these challenges, and we recognize the stressors on military children brought about by the unique demands of their parents' military life.</FP>
    <FP>
        The strength of our Armed Forces comes not just from those who wear the uniform, but from their families, who also serve on behalf of our country. As a Nation, we have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them 
        <PRTPAGE P="60"/>
        into harm's way, and to care for them and their families. The First Lady and I understand the gravity of this promise personally, and we have made supporting service members, veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors a top priority for my Administration.
    </FP>
    <FP>That is why the First Lady has committed to relaunching the Joining Forces initiative, mobilizing all Americans to continue the national commitment to support and engage our military families. By raising awareness about the unique aspects of military life and working toward solutions to its challenges, my Administration will continue to support military children and will help ensure that they have opportunities to grow and live out their dreams.</FP>
    <FP>Observing the Month of the Military Child demonstrates our support for military children who make daily sacrifices so their parents can keep our Nation safe. Military-connected children are strong and resilient, and we must match their strength with a commitment to provide the full support of our communities and our Government. I encourage all Americans to serve them as well as they serve us.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as the Month of the Military Child. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military children with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Cancer Control Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Despite the incredible advancements we have made in recent years, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. Behind this statistic are millions of Americans who know the distress of receiving a cancer diagnosis, and millions more who watch family members or friends courageously fight this disease and too often succumb to it. Cancer is brutal and cruel, and I intimately understand the incalculable human toll that this disease inflicts on patients and their loved ones—a toll that strikes communities of color at disproportionately high rates.</FP>
    <FP>
        During National Cancer Control Month, we celebrate the progress made against this disease, and we reaffirm our national commitment to preventing cancer, improving treatments and the delivery of care, and finding a cure. This includes efforts to improve cancer prevention, promote early detection, enhance treatment, and support the needs of cancer survivors 
        <PRTPAGE P="61"/>
        and caregivers. This issue is deeply personal for me—and as President, I am committed to ending cancer as we know it.
    </FP>
    <FP>Progress begins with helping people take steps to lower their risk for many kinds of cancer. Tobacco use remains the top cause of cancer deaths in the United States. By helping people quit smoking and limiting exposure to secondhand smoke, we can reduce cancer risk and save lives. Resources to help quit smoking can be found at SmokeFree.gov or by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Eating healthy, getting regular physical activity, limiting alcohol consumption, and reducing sun exposure when the sun is at its peak can also help reduce the risk of getting cancer.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is proud to support efforts like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Comprehensive Cancer Control and the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Programs, which help Americans in communities throughout the country get recommended cancer screenings. You can read more about these programs at cdc.gov/cancer.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also a proud supporter of ClinicalTrials.gov, the world's largest public clinical research database that gives patients, families, health care providers, researchers, and others easy access to information on clinical studies relating to a wide range of diseases and conditions, including cancer.</FP>
    <FP>This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act of 1971. This landmark legislation cemented our Nation's commitment to cancer research, establishing networks of cancer centers, clinical trials, data collection systems, and advanced research, without which many breakthroughs against cancer in recent years would not have occurred.</FP>
    <FP>In addition, the Cancer Moonshot, which former President Obama and I initiated in 2016, accelerated progress in cancer prevention, treatment, and cures, including by funding six Implementation Science Centers in cancer control. These centers were created to expand the use of proven cancer prevention and early detection strategies, especially among underserved, rural, and minority populations, which often have lower rates of cancer screening and thus find cancer at more advanced stages. You can read about these important research programs and breakthroughs by visiting cancer.gov.</FP>
    <FP>As part of the Cancer Moonshot, we also established the Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration to drive faster and better integrated development of drugs, medical devices, and biological and other products to tackle this devastating disease. Find out more at fda.gov.</FP>
    <FP>This year, we must be especially mindful of the significant disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to cancer care—delaying routine screening, diagnosis, and therapy. I urge Americans not to delay recommended screenings, doctor's visits, and treatments. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover a set of preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs, including many cancer screenings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration also announced a special enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace, allowing uninsured individuals and families to sign up for health coverage and gain these protections through August 15th. I encourage you to visit healthcare.gov to explore your eligibility and get covered today.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation has made extraordinary advances in the fight against cancer. Still, much work remains to be done. We owe it to every person who has 
        <PRTPAGE P="62"/>
        lost their battle with this disease, every person living with this disease, and every person who may one day contract it, to continue working tirelessly to defeat it. During National Cancer Control Month, let us renew our efforts to save lives and spare suffering by accelerating our work to end cancer as we know it.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National Cancer Control Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>As we begin to emerge from a year of unprecedented stress and hardship, children and families need our support more than ever. The confluence of a devastating pandemic and the worst economic crisis in nearly a century have increased the risk for child abuse and neglect as Americans grapple with the compounding challenges of school and child care facility closures, social isolation, and increased financial instability. Children and families of color—who so often across our history have been underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality—face even greater adversity today as they disproportionately carry the burdens of the COVID-19 crisis. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, and throughout the entire year, it is imperative that we join together as one Nation to combat child abuse in all of its forms—through neglect, mistreatment, or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.</FP>
    <FP>Community-based child abuse prevention programs are a critical tool for preventing the mistreatment of children and advancing equity. Authorized by Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the purpose of community-based child abuse prevention programs is to support local efforts that strengthen and support families to reduce the likelihood of child abuse. These programs offer comprehensive assistance that improves family stabilization, while also fostering meaningful engagement with diverse populations to promote effective prevention strategies.</FP>
    <FP>
        Across our country, a vast network of frontline workers, court and legal professionals, faith leaders, volunteers, teachers, and helpful loved ones and neighbors work every day to support the wellbeing of our children. They deserve our recognition and our sincere gratitude, particularly in the 
        <PRTPAGE P="63"/>
        midst of this difficult year. Though the pandemic has changed the ways that they interact with the families they serve, they have shown remarkable resilience, and their dedication to preventing child abuse continues to transform lives.
    </FP>
    <FP>We recognize that within the larger context of addressing child abuse, there is a need to specifically address issues of sexual violence against children and adolescents. My Administration is committed to expanding efforts to improve prevention initiatives, enhance trauma-informed responses to assist children and adolescents impacted by sexual violence, and work toward healing and justice. It is an imperative not only in the United States, but also in galvanizing global action to end sexual violence against children and adolescents.</FP>
    <FP>National Child Abuse Prevention Month is a time for us to not only honor those who work to support children and strengthen families, but to shine a light on the many ways we can all play a role in preventing children from being harmed. The Prevention Resource Guide, an annual publication by the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families Children's Bureau outlines actions that can be taken by communities, organizations, families, and individuals to address the root causes of child abuse and provide meaningful and equitable support to families. You can access the Prevention Resource Guide and other resources at the Child Welfare Information Gateway's Child Abuse Prevention Month website. By increasing efforts to prevent child abuse, we will help children, families, and communities thrive.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to protect our Nation's greatest resource—its children—and to take an active role in supporting children and parents and creating safe communities filled with thriving families.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Donate Life Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        April is National Donate Life Month, a time for all Americans to celebrate the generosity of those who have saved lives by becoming organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors—and to encourage more Americans to follow their example. We also honor the families and friends of donors who have supported their loved one's decision to donate, as well as the caring 
        <PRTPAGE P="64"/>
        and committed professionals who serve the transplantation community. This month-long observance also encompasses National Pediatric Transplant Week from April 18-24, a week dedicated to ending the pediatric transplant waiting list.
    </FP>
    <FP>Despite the extraordinary challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 saw organ transplants from deceased donors set an annual record for the 10th consecutive year—a testament to Americans' generosity and selflessness even in times of unbearable loss. Thanks to the resilience of our organ donation and transplantation professionals and the caring nature of the American people, more than 39,000 life-saving or life-enhancing organ transplants were performed in the United States last year from both living and deceased donors.</FP>
    <FP>While thousands of Americans receive the gift of life each year through organ transplantation, the number of people in need of life-saving organs remains staggeringly high. There are more than 107,000 people currently on the national transplant waiting list, and another person is added every nine minutes. Sadly, the waiting list currently contains more than 1,900 children under the age of 18 who are awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. While very small children most often must receive donations from other young children due to size constraints, older children and adults can often match. In many cases, that means generous American adults can contribute to our goal of ending the pediatric transplant waiting list.</FP>
    <FP>Current statistics show that Americans belonging to minority groups make up nearly 60 percent of those waiting for an organ transplant. Although a transplant can be successful regardless of the race or ethnicity of the donor and recipient, there is a greater chance of longer-term survival for the recipient if the genetic background of the donor and recipient are closely matched. Americans from every community are needed to help make a life-saving difference.</FP>
    <FP>Nearly 18,000 people are diagnosed each year with illnesses for which blood stem cell transplantation—requiring marrow or cord blood—is the best treatment option. Over 65 percent of these individuals require donors from outside their own family. Although some 30 million adults are currently registered as blood stem cell donors, many individuals still have difficulty finding a suitably matched donor, meaning that we need many more registrants to fill this life-saving need.</FP>
    <FP>Every day, 17 people in America die while waiting for a transplant. Yet, all of us have the power to help: one donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation, and can improve another 75 lives through eye and tissue donation. If you have not signed up as an organ donor, we need your help to fill the gap between the availability of organs and people who need them. I encourage all Americans to give hope to those awaiting a match by visiting organdonor.gov for organ, eye, and tissue donation, and bloodstemcell.hrsa.gov for marrow donation.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon every person to share the gift of life and hope with those in need of a life-saving or life-enhancing transplant by becoming organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>My Administration is working hard to help Americans overcome the financial impact of COVID-19 and the deep-rooted inequities in our society that have greatly limited the economic prosperity of too many Americans. Given the disproportionate impact the pandemic is having on minority and low-income communities, a concerted effort by the Federal Government is necessary for recovery and building back a better economy. Financial education that builds financial capability helps families receive assistance, build resilience, and benefit from a stronger and more equitable economy. April is recognized as National Financial Capability Month to highlight the value of high-quality financial education to improving Americans' financial capability.</FP>
    <FP>The Financial Literacy and Education Commission, a 23-member body of Federal agencies, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, was created to coordinate and improve financial education for all Americans. Its members are helping address the financial challenges our country faces as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Agencies are reaching American families with critical assistance and information on home mortgage forbearance, student loan repayment relief, unemployment assistance, and economic impact payments. Federal agencies are also alerting the public about scams, bogus investments, and other ways bad actors have tried to take advantage of people during this crisis.</FP>
    <FP>High-quality financial education should build on and respond to people's individual strengths, circumstances, and needs in order to help them work toward their own unique goals. Yet such high-quality financial education has not historically reached all Americans, especially our most underserved low-income and minority communities. This month, all financial educators in Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments, schools, and private sector organizations should recognize the systemic disparities in our society that have acted as barriers to financial well-being for too many families. They should redouble their efforts to better understand and effectively serve historically underserved people and communities, including people of color, low-income individuals, and persons with disabilities.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Sexual assault, at its core, is a devastating abuse of power—one that affects people of every age, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, socioeconomic background, and religion. It is the responsibility of each of us to stand up and speak out against it, not only to improve the laws and services available to survivors, but also to change the culture and attitudes that allow sexual assault to proliferate. Together, we must work toward a society that upholds every person's right to live free from sexual violence—where our institutions and communities commit to preventing sexual assault and sexual harassment, supporting survivors, and holding offenders accountable.</FP>
    <FP>The pandemic has exacerbated the already harrowing challenges facing sexual assault survivors by making it more difficult or risky for them to seek help. Victims may be reluctant to go to the hospital for a medical forensic exam because of the risk of COVID-19 exposure; rape crisis centers and other social service providers have struggled to maintain their services while adopting necessary public health protocols; and survivors are often isolated from loved ones, friends, or co-workers who might be in the best position to provide support. As we race to stop the spread of this devastating virus, we must strengthen our efforts to support sexual assault survivors whose suffering may be compounded by this pandemic, as well as by the economic crisis that has further undermined their economic security and taken a toll on service providers.</FP>
    <FP>We also must recognize that sexual assault was already a public health crisis even before the pandemic struck. According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, done by the CDC, one in five women has been a victim of a completed or attempted rape at some point in her lifetime. Research has revealed a strong link between sexual violence and chronic disease, as well as greater long-term economic burdens on survivors of sexual assault. The trauma of assault is further compounded by the high costs of medical and mental health care, navigating the criminal justice system, and lost productivity.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration stands with survivors, and is committed to alleviating the public health crisis of sexual assault. As part of the American Rescue 
        <PRTPAGE P="67"/>
        Plan (ARP), we included $450 million in supplemental funding for domestic violence and sexual assault services, including rape crisis centers. Recognizing the added barriers faced by survivors from historically marginalized communities—particularly survivors who are Black, Indigenous, Latino, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other people of color—the ARP includes new funding to support community-based organizations to provide culturally-specific services for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence.
    </FP>
    <FP>I am also proud to have created the first-ever White House Gender Policy Council, through an Executive Order that I signed on International Women's Day. In addition to its work to bring a whole-of-government approach to gender equity in every policy we pursue, this Council will help coordinate Federal agencies to develop a National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. I have also established an independent review commission that will provide recommendations to help guide the development of new policies and enforcement measures in keeping with my Administration's unwavering commitment to improving the response to, and prevention of, sexual assault and sexual harassment in the military.</FP>
    <FP>To strengthen our national commitment to end gender-based violence, we must also renew and further improve the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Writing and championing the passage of VAWA as a Senator is one of my proudest legislative accomplishments—it is a law that has transformed the way our country responds to sexual assault and intimate partner violence. With each reauthorization, I have worked with the Congress to expand VAWA's provisions on a bipartisan basis to improve protections, including for Native American women, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, as well as immigrant survivors and survivors from communities of color and other underserved groups. I applaud the House of Representatives for recently passing the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2021 with bipartisan support, and I urge the Senate to follow their lead to renew and strengthen this landmark law immediately. Through this legislation, we can continue to support Federal programs with a proven track record of helping survivors heal, strengthen the coordinated community response, improve the response of the criminal justice system, and provide additional pathways to safety by supporting innovative programs and prevention efforts.</FP>
    <FP>We have made important strides thanks to courageous survivors and dedicated advocates. This month, we honor the strength and resilience of sexual assault survivors, and we recommit ourselves to standing with them for safety, dignity, and justice. There is still much work to do, and it will take all of us to do it. This year's Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is an opportunity for every person, employer, school, sports team, faith-based organization, and institution to come together and commit to being part of the solution. We must rededicate ourselves to creating a society where sexual violence—including sexual assault and sexual harassment—is not tolerated, where survivors are supported, and where all people have an opportunity to thrive without fear of abuse or assault.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Second Chance Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America's criminal justice system must offer meaningful opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation. After incarcerated individuals serve their time, they should have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society. It benefits not just those individuals but all of society, and it is the best strategy to reduce recidivism. During Second Chance Month, we lift up all those who, having made mistakes, are committed to rejoining society and making meaningful contributions.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to a holistic approach to building safe and healthy communities. This includes preventing crime and providing opportunities for all Americans. It also requires rethinking the existing criminal justice system—whom we send to prison and for how long; how people are treated while incarcerated; how prepared they are to reenter society once they have served their time; and the racial inequities that lead to the disproportionate number of incarcerated Black and Brown people.</FP>
    <FP>We must commit to second chances from the earliest stages of our criminal justice system. Supporting second chances means, for example, diverting individuals who have used illegal drugs to drug court programs and treatment instead of prison. It requires eliminating exceedingly long sentences and mandatory minimums that keep people incarcerated longer than they should be. It means providing quality job training and educational opportunities during incarceration to prepare individuals for the 21st century economy. And it means reinvesting the savings from reduced incarceration into reentry programs and social services that prevent recidivism and leave us all better off.</FP>
    <FP>More than 600,000 individuals return to their communities from State and Federal prisons every year. Transitioning back into society can be overwhelming for those who are formerly incarcerated as well as their families and communities. Too many individuals face unfair legal and practical barriers to reentry. The reentry process is complicated in the best of times, and is even more so with the additional difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>
        We must remove these barriers. Every person leaving incarceration should have housing, the opportunity at a decent job, and health care. A person's 
        <PRTPAGE P="69"/>
        conviction history should not unfairly exclude them from employment, occupational licenses, access to credit, public benefits, or the right to vote. Certain criminal records should be expunged and sealed so people can overcome their past.
    </FP>
    <FP>By focusing on prevention, reentry, and social support, rather than incarceration, we can ensure that America is a land of second chances and opportunity for all people.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as Second Chance Month.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On World Autism Awareness Day, we celebrate the countless ways that people with autism contribute to our families, our communities, our Nation, and the world, and we shine a light on the systemic barriers people with autism face in their daily lives.</FP>
    <FP>More than 2 percent of American adults and 1 in every 54 of our children have autism—a community of millions who deserve to live full lives of dignity and respect. My Administration is committed to funding cutting-edge research to help us to better understand autism and related health conditions in order to improve quality of life for people with autism and their families in every community.</FP>
    <FP>Recent Government initiatives have focused on detecting autism in the first year of life, funding new national research networks to improve our knowledge of autism, and advancing services and support to help Americans with autism live independently in their communities. A recent apprenticeship initiative from the Department of Labor seeks to open up career pathways for people with autism and other developmental disabilities in thriving fields like information technology and health care. Investments like these and others that we continue to pursue are critical to expanding possibilities and improving life for all people with autism.</FP>
    <FP>
        Meanwhile, agencies across the Federal Government are working to protect the rights of all people with disabilities—including people with autism—while also advancing equity when it comes to accessing vital services and 
        <PRTPAGE P="70"/>
        supports. Our research agencies are working to reduce barriers in access to early diagnoses, interventions, and services for people with autism—including those from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and rural communities—and to incorporate the perspectives of individuals with autism in scientific research. For too long, disparities in access to health care, education, and services have placed an undue burden on individuals with disabilities and their loved ones, particularly those from underserved communities. My Administration is committed to addressing these inequities in partnership with the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and the National Autism Coordinator of the Department of Health and Human Services.
    </FP>
    <FP>We also recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unique disruptions to, and placed new strains on, the lives of individuals with autism and their families. All Americans should be grateful for the creativity and dedication of educators, health care providers, and others who have rapidly adapted to the limitations of the pandemic by offering virtual learning, telehealth appointments, and other remote services. My Administration is working tirelessly to get America vaccinated, get our children safely back in school, and deliver direct economic relief to families across the country in order to end this year of disruption and alleviate as much of the burden as possible. In addition, agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Education are hard at work developing data-driven guidance to help people with disabilities and their families mitigate the far-reaching effects of the pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>Today, we honor those with autism and recommit ourselves to providing them and their families with the investment, support, and care they need to live independently, fully participate in their communities, and live fulfilling lives of dignity and opportunity.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2021, as World Autism Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to learn more about autism to improve early diagnosis, to learn more about the experiences of autistic people from autistic people, and to build more welcoming and inclusive communities to support people with autism.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On Yom HaShoah—Holocaust Remembrance Day—we stand in solidarity with the Jewish people in America, Israel, and around the world to remember and reflect on the horrors of the Holocaust. An estimated six million Jews perished alongside millions of other innocent victims—Roma and Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others—systematically murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators in one of the cruelest and most heinous campaigns in human history.</FP>
    <FP>We honor the memories of precious lives lost, contemplate the incomprehensible wound to our humanity, mourn for the communities broken and scattered, and embrace those who survived the Holocaust—some of whom are still with us today, continuing to embody extraordinary resilience after all these years. Having borne witness to the depths of evil, these survivors remind us of the vital refrain: “never again.” The history of the Holocaust is forever seared into the history of humankind, and it is the shared responsibility of all people to ensure that the horrors of the Shoah can never be erased from our collective memory.</FP>
    <FP>It is painful to remember. It is human nature to want to leave the past behind. But in order to prevent a tragedy like the Holocaust from happening again, we must share the truth of this dark period with each new generation. All of us must understand the depravity that is possible when governments back policies fueled by hatred, when we dehumanize groups of people, and when ordinary people decide that it is easier to look away or go along than to speak out. Our children and grandchildren must learn where those roads lead, so that the commitment of “never again” lives strongly in their hearts.</FP>
    <FP>I remember learning about the horrors of the Holocaust from my father when I was growing up, and I have sought to impart that history to my own children and grandchildren in turn. I have taken them on separate visits to Dachau, so that they could see for themselves what happened there, and to impress on them the urgency to speak out whenever they witness anti-Semitism or any form of ethnic and religious hatred, racism, homophobia, or xenophobia. The legacy of the Holocaust must always remind us that silence in the face of such bigotry is complicity—remembering, as Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote, that there are moments when “indifference to evil is worse than evil itself.”</FP>
    <FP>
        Those who survived the Holocaust are an inspiration to every single one of us. Yet they continue to live with the unique mental and physical scars from the unconscionable trauma of the Holocaust, with many survivors in the United States living in poverty. When I served as Vice President, I helped secure Federal funding for grants to support Holocaust survivors—but we must do more to pursue justice and dignity for survivors and their heirs. We have a moral imperative to recognize the pain survivors carry, support them, and ensure that their memories and experiences of the Holocaust are neither denied nor distorted, and that the lessons for all humanity are never forgotten.
        <PRTPAGE P="72"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Holocaust survivors and their descendants—and each child, grandchild, and great-grandchild of those who lost their lives—are living proof that love and hope will always triumph over murder and destruction. Every child and grandchild of a survivor is a testament to resilience, and a living rebuke to those who sought to extinguish the future of the Jewish people and others who were targeted.</FP>
    <FP>Yom HaShoah reminds us not only of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, but also reinforces our ongoing duty to counter all forms of dehumanizing bigotry directed against the LGBTQ+, disability, and other marginalized communities. While hate may never be permanently defeated, it must always be confronted and condemned. When we recognize the fundamental human dignity of all people, we help to build a more just and peaceful world. In the memory of all those who were lost, and in honor of all those who survived, we must continue to work toward a better, freer, and more just future for all humankind.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 4 through April 11, 2021, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, and call upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Public Health Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>National Public Health Week has increased significance this year, as our Nation mourns the loss of more than half a million lives to COVID-19, and as we have come to recognize just how essential our public health efforts and public health workers truly are. Whether it is the scientists and researchers who developed life-saving vaccines in record time; or local leaders who have taken evidence-based action to keep their communities safe; or the staff and volunteers who have worked to slow the spread of the virus through testing, case investigation, and contact tracing; or the doctors, nurses, and clinicians who continue to provide around-the-clock care to those who have fallen ill, dedicated public health professionals on the front lines of our response to COVID-19 deserve our gratitude.</FP>
    <FP>During National Public Health Week, we ask everyone to come together to help restore the health of our Nation. Every American can do their patriotic duty for their neighbors, their loved ones, and our country by continuing to wear masks as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, practicing physical distancing, getting the COVID-19 vaccine when it is their turn, and by expressing gratitude to public health professionals who are seeing us through this crisis and who are building a more robust, comprehensive, and equitable public health system for all.</FP>
    <FP>While defeating the coronavirus is our top public health priority, our Nation must also focus on improving our overall health and wellbeing. Greater health is good for us all, and it will bolster our national resilience in the face of new and existing threats. The United States must prioritize and continually invest in our public health system to aggressively address health disparities that have been exposed and worsened by COVID-19. We must also address the environmental and climate factors—air and water pollution, extreme weather, and climate-related disaster events—that threaten public health in communities nationwide. The American Jobs Plan will help to achieve these goals, including by ensuring that children who live along highways and fence lines of industrial facilities will breathe easier because of significant investments in clean energy and infrastructure that promotes public health. Our Nation must also take commonsense steps to address the gun violence public health epidemic, including actions to counter the historic spike in homicides occurring in cities across the country and disproportionately affecting Black and brown Americans. Only by addressing the root causes of health inequity can we build a fairer, stronger, more dependable health system for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is committed to investing in our public health system to not only defeat the pandemic, but also to build a stronger public health system that allows us to be ready for the next virus. The American Rescue Plan provides critical funding to increase the number of vaccination sites, which will help us get Americans vaccinated more quickly so that we can get back to our lives and loved ones. The law also invests in COVID-19 containment measures such as testing and contact tracing, funds our efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical medical equipment, and 
        <PRTPAGE P="74"/>
        makes health insurance more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. Finally, the law invests in crucial measures like air quality monitoring, water and sewer infrastructure, and brownfield remediation so that Americans in every community can live in a healthy environment.
    </FP>
    <FP>The American Rescue Plan does more than put checks in Americans' pockets—it provides assistance to help stabilize State, local, Tribal, and territorial budgets and keep vital public health services running. It provides the resources schools need to reopen safely, allowing students to return to the classroom and alleviating the negative health effects that come from isolation, changes in routines, and loss of learning. The American Rescue Plan will also mobilize a generation of future leaders to serve in an enhanced public health workforce, increasing our long-term public health capacity. This law also provides much-needed help to nearly 1,400 Community Health Centers that serve our most vulnerable populations, who are at the highest risk of infection and adverse outcomes from COVID-19.</FP>
    <FP>As we continue working tirelessly to defeat the pandemic and build a stronger public health system for the future, I ask every American to mark National Public Health Week by remembering all those who give their time, expertise, and care—and even put their lives on the line—in service of a healthier, safer, and stronger America for all of us.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Fair Housing Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Exactly 1 week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., struck at the soul of our Nation, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a landmark piece of legislation—an enduring testament to the ideals of Dr. King that enshrined a portion of his legacy in the lives and laws of the American people. Fifty-three years later, the Fair Housing Act still serves as a powerful statement about who we are as a people: the values of equality, equity, and dignity that we strive to uphold, and the places where we still have work to do to fulfill our full promise as a Nation.</FP>
    <FP>The purpose of the Fair Housing Act was to put an end to inequities in our housing system and eliminate racial segregation in American neighborhoods—and guarantee that all people in America have the right to obtain the housing of their choice, free from discrimination. The law prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, and requires Federal, State, and local governments to proactively dismantle the discriminatory structures that held back people of color and other underserved populations from equitable access to the neighborhoods of their choice.</FP>
    <FP>
        By helping to create a fairer housing system, the law seeks to do more than just open up American neighborhoods to all Americans. Access to quality housing is about more than having a roof over your head—it is the foundation for achieving better educational, employment, and health outcomes, as well as one of the most important ways that families build wealth that they 
        <PRTPAGE P="76"/>
        can pass along across the generations. The Fair Housing Act was created at a time when Federal and State policies held that dream at arm's length from far too many Black, Brown, Native, and Asian American families through the insidious practices of redlining and lending discrimination.
    </FP>
    <FP>Over the course of 53 years, the law has made a world of difference in the lives of countless families and communities. We have also improved upon it through the years; as a Senator, I was proud to co-sponsor the 1988 Fair Housing Act amendments that extended the law's protections to Americans with disabilities and families with children, and just 2 months ago my Administration issued a rule change to ensure that the law finally guards against discrimination targeting LGBTQ+ Americans. But the truth of the matter is that we have not fully achieved the goals of the Fair Housing Act—we still have so much work to do.</FP>
    <FP>Many of our neighborhoods remain as segregated today as they were in the middle of the 20th century, and the racial wealth gap is wider now than it was when the Fair Housing Act was passed. Though our Nation has come a long way in many regards, our promise will not be fulfilled as long as anyone in America is denied a good home or a fair shot because of who they are. It is our shared duty to work together to ensure that every person has equitable access to all of the opportunities our communities provide—and that no one faces barriers to getting a good education, having quality health care, eating healthy food, or finding stable employment that allows their family to thrive solely because of where they live. This is a moral responsibility that cannot wait, particularly at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted and exacerbated the lack of safe, affordable places to live for far too many people in America.</FP>
    <FP>To affirm equal opportunity as the bedrock of our democracy—and to enlist the entire Federal Government to address entrenched disparities in our laws, public policies, and institutions—I signed an Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government on my first day in office. To ensure that the Federal Government continues to prioritize the right to fair housing and actively enforce our Federal civil rights laws, I also signed a Presidential Memorandum on Redressing Our Nation's and the Federal Government's History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies during my first week as President. My Administration will continue our efforts to close persistent racial gaps in wages, housing, credit, lending opportunities, and access to higher education—gaps that, if closed, would add an estimated $5 trillion in gross domestic product in the American economy over the next 5 years. We are committed to doing all we can to end unlawful housing discrimination and advance equity for all underserved populations, fulfill the full promise of the Fair Housing Act, and put the American dream within reach of all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2021 as National Fair Housing Month. I call upon the people of this Nation to help secure freedom and justice for every American by taking action to fulfill the promise made by the Fair Housing Act to ensure everyone has free and fair housing choice.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Black Maternal Health Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the United States of America, a person's race should never determine their health outcomes, and pregnancy and childbirth should be safe for all. However, for far too many Black women, safety and equity have been tragically denied. America's maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the developed world, and they are especially high among Black mothers, who die from complications related to pregnancy at roughly two to three times the rate of white, Hispanic, Asian American, and Pacific Islander women—regardless of their income or education levels. This week, I call on all Americans to recognize the importance of addressing the crisis of Black maternal mortality and morbidity in this country.</FP>
    <FP>Ensuring that all women have equitable access to health care before, during, and after pregnancy is essential. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to addressing these unacceptable disparities, and to building a health care system that delivers equity and dignity to Black, Indigenous, and other women and girls of color.</FP>
    <FP>Health care is a right, not a privilege, and our country needs a health care system that works for all of us. That is something both Vice President Harris and I have fought for throughout our careers. As a Senator, Vice President Harris was a champion of Black maternal health, introducing legislation to close gaps in access to quality maternal care and educate providers about implicit bias. And during my time as Vice President, I fought for the Affordable Care Act and to strengthen Medicaid, both of which ensure access to critical services to support maternal health. Within just a few years of the Affordable Care Act's passage, Black uninsured rates dramatically declined—a key factor in ensuring better maternal health outcomes—as did the persistent health insurance coverage gap between Black and white Americans, which fell by more than 40 percent in the wake of the law's implementation.</FP>
    <FP>As we fight to bring an end to the COVID-19 crisis, we will continue to make quality health care more accessible and affordable for all Americans, as we did through the passage of the landmark American Rescue Plan. We will also work to ensure that everyone—including hospitals, insurance plans, and health care providers—do their part to provide every American with quality, affordable, and equitable care.</FP>
    <FP>
        Vice President Harris and I are committed to pursuing systemic policies that provide comprehensive, holistic maternal health care that is free from bias and discrimination. The morbidity and mortality disparities that Black 
        <PRTPAGE P="78"/>
        mothers face are not the results of isolated incidents. Our Nation must root out systemic racism everywhere it exists, including by addressing unequal social determinants of health that often contribute to racial disparities such as adequate nutrition and housing, toxin-free environments, high-paying job sectors that provide paid leave, and workplaces free of harassment and discrimination.
    </FP>
    <FP>Addressing systemic barriers across the board will improve outcomes for Black mothers and their families, and make our entire country stronger, healthier, and more prosperous. At the same time, the United States must also grow and diversify the perinatal workforce, improve how we collect data to better understand the causes of maternal death and complications from birth, and invest in community-based organizations to help reduce the glaring racial and ethnic disparities that persist in our health care system.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11 through April 17, 2021, as Black Maternal Health Week.

    <FP>One hundred and thirty-one years ago, our hemisphere formed the International Union of American Republics—the oldest regional international organization in the world, and the precursor to the modern-day Organization of American States. On this Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we reaffirm the strength of our regional community, celebrate the democratic principles that unite us, and resolve to work together to overcome the common challenges before us.</FP>
    <FP>
        So many of the greatest challenges facing us today are not confined to our respective national boundaries. The global COVID-19 crisis has laid bare persistent inequalities in our societies and structural weaknesses in our economies. Climate change poses an urgent national security threat that is hurting communities throughout the region today and jeopardizing future

        generations. We are witnessing a humanitarian crisis and mass displacement in Venezuela that is among the worst in history. Violence and endemic corruption, particularly in Central America, are causing desperate people to uproot their lives and families in hopes of a better future elsewhere.
    </FP>
    <FP>No nation can address today's challenges alone or hide from them behind walls. A secure, economically prosperous, and democratic hemisphere is overwhelmingly in the economic and national security interest of the United States and the entire Pan American region. Moreover, it is within our capacity to reach that future if we rally together and unite around principled and democratic leadership—anchored in the rule of law.</FP>
    <FP>The people of our hemisphere want governments that are accountable to voters and deliver real benefits: good-paying jobs that allow hard-working people to provide for their families, education for their children, security in their communities, and a future where equal opportunity and fundamental human and political rights are guaranteed to all people.</FP>
    <FP>This year, as we mark the 20th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, each of our governments has an obligation to renew, promote, and defend that groundbreaking commitment we made—that all people who call the Americas home have a right to democracy. The Democratic Charter remains at the core of our hemispheric union, working through the Organization of American States, to advance a bold and determined vision of a region whose governments honor and respect democratic values, human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the inherent dignity of each individual. During this Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we celebrate our unity and cooperation—and resolve to work together to overcome the challenges ahead of us and build a better world.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Millions of people in the United States are victims of crime every year. Some endure horrific acts of violence, some have personal possessions damaged or stolen, and others are defrauded or exploited financially. Whatever the crime, many victims lose something that can never be fully recovered:  a sense of trust and safety. Yet we find inspiration and hope in their stories of triumph over adversity and resilience in the wake of tragedy. During this 40th National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we support crime victims throughout the United States and the many dedicated people who serve them.</FP>
    <FP>The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes that true justice requires that victims get the support and assistance they need. Today, victims have access to quality services in their communities through the more than 7,000 local programs funded by the Federal Crime Victims Fund, as well as from other sources of Federal funding, including supplemental funding for victim services in the American Rescue Plan. In spite of this network of support, persistent barriers still prevent many victims from obtaining the support and services they need and the justice they deserve. Fewer than half of violent victimizations are reported to police, and research shows that even fewer reports of rapes or sexual assaults are brought to the attention of law enforcement. There are a variety of reasons why many victims of crime are less likely to report a crime, including fear of negative interactions with law enforcement or the criminal justice system, which disproportionately impacts victims from communities of color. Together, we must commit to the accountability and reform necessary to build trust, increase access to services, and improve public safety.</FP>
    <FP>
        We must also listen to the voices of those who have experienced gun violence. Gun violence not only impacts its victims, but also their families, friends, colleagues, first responders, and local communities. These brave voices—along with the majority of gun-owners who support commonsense 
        <PRTPAGE P="82"/>
        measures to keep our communities safe—are speaking up and speaking out for public policy that will put a stop to the violence. My Administration is committed to doing everything we can to end the epidemic of gun violence.
    </FP>
    <FP>Supporting crime victims is part of a larger effort to advance equity and fairness in our society. The Office for Victims of Crime at the Department of Justice is investing in efforts to improve access to services and safety for victims and communities that have been historically marginalized and underserved, as well as support community initiatives to prevent violence. My Administration is taking action to address the surge in anti-Asian violence and harassment, including efforts to prevent hate crimes and build trust with law enforcement. My Administration is also working closely with Tribal governments to help victims in American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and supporting community-driven efforts to reach victims of hate crimes.</FP>
    <FP>Every crime victim deserves justice and the assurance that their safety, wellbeing, and welfare will be protected. We must work together to prevent crimes and ensure that all victims have a place to turn, and the support they need to recover.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 2021, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims' rights and services and by volunteering to serve victims in need.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Volunteer Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>We are living in a moment that calls for hope and light and love. Hope for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another. Volunteers provide all three. Service—the act of looking out for one another—is part of who we are as a Nation. Our commitment to service reflects our understanding that we can best meet our challenges when we join together. This week, we recognize the enduring contributions of our Nation's volunteers and encourage more Americans to join their ranks.</FP>
    <FP>
        The tremendous power of volunteers and volunteerism has been on dramatic display in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All across the country, retired doctors and nurses, students and veterans, personnel from across the Federal Government, and countless others have given their time and talent to administer vaccines, staff vaccination centers, boost testing, 
        <PRTPAGE P="83"/>
        tracing, and other life-saving public health measures, and provide food, water, and other necessities to those at heightened risk so they can remain safely at home.
    </FP>
    <FP>Volunteers of all ages and walks of life have stepped forward in other ways to meet this moment. When a severe winter storm left millions without power in Texas and wildfires ravaged our Western States, neighbors from near and far provided food, shelter, and support. Throughout this unprecedented year, people across America have given help and hope by checking on isolated seniors, helping the jobless, and tutoring students to help them stay on track in school. Their compassion reminds us that even in our darkest hours, Americans look out for one another.</FP>
    <FP>To meet the unprecedented challenges of today and build back better for tomorrow, we must unite around a renewed commitment to service and to civic duty. As we work to defeat the pandemic, strengthen our economy, address racial inequity, and tackle the climate crisis, we need more Americans to get involved. Government cannot do the job alone, but government—working together with nonprofits and community organizations, the private sector, and the American people—can make our country stronger, more prosperous, and ready for the future.</FP>
    <FP>When more Americans step forward to serve, it renews our sense of community and strengthens our democracy. Acts of service unite people from different backgrounds and allow us to truly see and hear one another.</FP>
    <FP>By helping others, volunteers also help themselves. They learn new skills, expand their professional networks, connect with neighbors, and experience the satisfaction that comes from serving a larger cause. Service can provide a pathway to employment, education, and other career-building opportunities. As we reopen our economy and build back better, volunteerism can help the unemployed find work and make our communities more resilient and prepared.</FP>
    <FP>The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to expanding service opportunities for Americans, including opportunities that enable us to confront the toughest challenges faced by our Nation. The American Rescue Plan includes a historic investment in AmeriCorps to make national service more accessible. We seek to enable more service members and volunteers to support vaccination efforts, tackle the growing hunger crisis, address learning loss, and meet other critical community needs.</FP>
    <FP>During National Volunteer Week, we celebrate the millions of Americans who volunteer and encourage more to follow their path. Every American has something to give. No matter your age, background, or where you come from, you can have an impact through service. Vice President Harris and I salute every American who takes time to help their neighbors, and we applaud the extraordinary faith-based, nonprofit, national service, military service, and community organizations that make this service possible.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 2021, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by volunteering in service projects across the country and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Park Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        The renowned environmentalist and author, Rachel Carson, wrote in her seminal book 
        <E T="03">Silent Spring</E>
         that, “Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts. There is something healing in the repeated refrains of nature—the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter.” Nowhere is the truth of her observation more evident than in America's national parks, which are irreplaceable treasures that amaze us, inspire us, fill us with pride, and belong to all of us in equal measure.
    </FP>
    <FP>Even while maintaining social distancing and wearing masks to protect themselves and one another, 237 million people visited our national parks last year to enjoy these singular wonders of our Nation. Every visit leaves an indelible impression—due not only to the natural splendor of each park, but to the dedicated stewardship of the Department of the Interior and National Park Service.</FP>
    <FP>I will never forget one of my own such visits, which has long shaped my personal reverence for our national parks. In 1972, after my wife and daughter were killed in a car accident, my two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were hospitalized for an extended period. As they recovered, they became enamored of the idea of visiting Yellowstone—thanks in large part to a favorite TV show, Yogi Bear, which was set in a fictionalized version of America's first national park. In the summer of 1974, my boys and I flew into Salt Lake City, rented a camper, drove up through Dinosaur National Park and arrived for a week at Yellowstone. Our time there nourished us, filled us with awe, and restored in all of us a sense of the future that had been quieted by our loss. As I saw my sons reengage with the world after enduring so much pain, and felt our family begin to heal, I came to understand the truth of Rachel Carson's words—the power and promise of these extraordinary places to replenish something within us.</FP>
    <FP>
        That power touches every American lucky enough to visit our national parks in some way, and it is our responsibility to ensure that our national parks reflect, honor, and serve all of our people and every community. Recent additions to the National Park System, such as the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument, the Reconstruction Era National Historical Park, the Stonewall National Monument, and the César Chávez National Monument at the Chávez Residence in Delano, California—along with programs such as the African American Civil Rights Network, Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, and Tribal Heritage grants—reflect our commitment for our parks to serve as sources of support, validation, 
        <PRTPAGE P="85"/>
        healing, and connection for people of color, Indigenous people, and others who have been historically marginalized and neglected. Our work to bring true equity to our parks is not yet done. The National Park System must continue to evolve to better reflect all of the people of our Nation, and to work in partnership with Tribal Nations whose historic and sacred lands often fall within the boundaries of National Parks and Monuments that have been dedicated through the years.
    </FP>
    <FP>During National Park Week, let us dedicate ourselves to greater improvement, enjoyment, and preservation of our natural treasures, and to continue to find inspiration, strength, and all else we seek within them.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17 through April 25, 2021, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to find their park, recreate responsibly, and enjoy the benefits that come from spending time in the natural world. I also ask all park visitors to do their part to stop the spread of the coronavirus by wearing masks and practicing social distancing.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, our Nation mourns the loss of one of our Nation's most dedicated patriots and public servants. Walter Frederick “Fritz” Mondale served the people of Minnesota as their Attorney General from 1960-1964, as a United States Senator from 1964-1976, as Vice President of the United States from 1977-1981, and as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 1993-1996.</FP>
    <FP>As Minnesota's Attorney General, he drew national attention in a landmark case before the U.S. Supreme Court that established that indigent criminal defendants have the right to legal counsel.</FP>
    <FP>As a Senator, he was instrumental in the passage of The Fair Housing Act to combat racial discrimination in housing, Title IX to provide more opportunities for women, and numerous laws to protect our environment.</FP>
    <FP>Walter Mondale defined the modern vice presidency, elevating the position into a true partnership with the President. As Vice President, he helped lay the groundwork for the 1978 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, the Panama Canal Treaty, and nuclear arms negotiations with the Soviet Union.</FP>
    <FP>
        As the 1984 Democratic nominee for President, he made history when he became the first Presidential nominee of either party to select a woman as his running mate.
        <PRTPAGE P="86"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In continuing his service as the United States Ambassador to Japan, he became the voice and face of America to that important ally.</FP>
    <FP>For nearly 60 years he had a remarkable partnership with his wife Joan, a devoted advocate for the arts, who passed away in 2014. We mourned when he lost his daughter Eleanor in 2011 and today our Nation's sympathies lie with his sons Ted and William and his six grandchildren.</FP>
    <FP>On a wall at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, there is a quote from Walter Mondale. It reads, “We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.” Walter Mondale did all that and more.</FP>
    <FP>As a mark of respect for Walter Mondale and his life of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 7 of title 4, United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Earth Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On April 22, 1970, millions of Americans rallied together to protect the right of all of us to live free from environmental hazard and harm. On that first Earth Day, they gathered all across America—on college campuses, in public parks, and State capitals—galvanized by a vision of a healthier, more prosperous Nation where all people could thrive. Their untiring spirit sparked a national movement for environmental protection that endures today in the bedrock laws that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and treasured wild places and wildlife.</FP>
    <FP>
        Earth Day was primarily conceived and brought to life by a dedicated public servant: the late Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. Senator Nelson and his wife, Carrie Lee—who herself passed away just last month—were both dear friends who changed my life; it was Senator Nelson who helped persuade me to remain in the Senate after losing my first wife and daughter in a car accident in 1972. Senator Nelson changed the world, too, by building a legacy of environmental protection through Earth Day and all of the progress that has come in its wake—not because it was popular, but because it was the right thing to do for our children and grandchildren.
        <PRTPAGE P="87"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Over half a century later, that legacy lives on in the chorus of courageous young people across the world who are rising up to demand action on climate change. They recognize the enormous economic opportunity to build a brighter, more prosperous future, and the dire economic, societal, and national security consequences of failing to act. Our youth remind us that a better world is within our grasp. Today, I say to young people fighting for a brighter future: We hear you. We see you. We will not let you down.</FP>
    <FP>In recent years, climate change has upended the lives of millions of Americans. Record cold weather knocked out the electric grid in Texas this winter, killing at least 111 people and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of millions more. Wildfires tore through more than 5 million acres across the American West—an area roughly the size of the entire State of New Jersey burned to the ground. Last year, back-to-back hurricanes and powerful tropical storms battered the Gulf and East Coasts in the worst Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts devastated families and communities across the Midwest. People have lost homes and irreplaceable memories of their loved ones, small businesses built from years of tireless labor and sacrifice, farmland meant to be passed on to the next generation, and so much more.</FP>
    <FP>At the same time, Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other communities of color continue to be hit hardest by the impacts of climate change. They bear the highest burden of pollution, face higher rates of heart and lung disease, are least likely to have safe drinking water in their homes, and suffer increased risk of death from COVID-19. These communities have also frequently been shut out of government decisions that directly bear on their interests. We have an obligation to correct these historic wrongs and to build a future where all people have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, healthy communities in which they can live, work, and learn, and a meaningful voice in their future.</FP>
    <FP>That is why my Administration is advancing the most ambitious climate agenda in our Nation's history. Our clean energy plan will create millions of good-paying union jobs, ensure our economic competitiveness, and improve the health and security of communities across America. By making those investments and putting millions of Americans to work, the United States will be able to cut our greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.</FP>
    <FP>Our success in confronting the climate crisis will not be ours alone. It will be shaped, bolstered, and ultimately won by a united pledge from global leaders to set the world on a path to a clean energy future. Today, on the fifth anniversary of the United States ratifying the Paris Agreement, we have brought nations from across the world together to meet the moment and raise our climate ambitions.</FP>
    <FP>More than 50 years ago, a generation rallied to confront the environmental crises they faced. They took action in hopes that those in power would listen. Today, a new generation is sounding the alarm louder than ever, demanding that world leaders act. It is in all our interests to rise to that challenge and let our legacy be one of action.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2021, as Earth Day.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>This year, on World Intellectual Property Day, we celebrate the innovators and creators who enrich our lives and create the products, services, companies, and industries of tomorrow. We especially recognize the power of intellectual property protection in allowing our small businesses to compete, thrive, and play their important role as the heart and soul of our communities and the engines of our economic progress.</FP>
    <FP>Small businesses are critical to our success as a Nation. They make up 90 percent of businesses in the United States, employ nearly half of America's private sector workers, and create two-thirds of new jobs, and bring opportunity to every corner of our Nation. Inventions born in the garages of small towns can have just as much impact as those developed in high-tech labs. This year's World Intellectual Property Day highlights the critical role these small businesses play in our society and the ways intellectual property can help support their continued growth and resilience.</FP>
    <FP>Every small business starts with one person's or one family's dream. When that dream is coupled with grit and determination, ideas turn into products, brands, and creative works. Pair those ideas with the strength of our intellectual property system and you have the foundation necessary for new business opportunities, increased employment, and greater economic prosperity.</FP>
    <FP>The various types of intellectual property—trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets—help to ensure that small businesses will be compensated for, and be able to prosper from their creations and their customer service. Without these protections, a small business's success could easily prove to be its undoing, as unscrupulous competitors could seek to copy, steal, and unduly profit from the small business's ideas and its hard-earned customer goodwill.</FP>
    <FP>We must also recognize the important role science and technology play in safeguarding our intellectual property. Investing in and strengthening our digital infrastructure promotes innovation that helps small businesses and protects the rights of our citizens.</FP>
    <FP>
        This year marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Lanham Act, which is this Nation's fundamental trademark law. Trademark protection 
        <PRTPAGE P="89"/>
        enables small businesses to benefit from the investments that they make to establish brand awareness and brand loyalty. In addition, trademarks help to protect consumers from counterfeits and other deceitful practices that defraud them and endanger their health and safety.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Workers Memorial Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        America's workers are the backbone of our economy. In every State, territory, and Tribal land, they leave their homes and families and head to work—applying their grit and skill to create, serve, and service all those things that make our world turn. Even during our Nation's most difficult periods, American workers have always persevered, ensuring that our communities remain resilient and that our Nation stands ready to confront the unforeseen challenges of each new generation. Though workers make tremendous sacrifices—especially essential workers who selflessly serve their communities during times of crisis—none of them should have to risk injury, illness, or death in order to provide for themselves and their families. Tragically, thousands of workers are killed and millions more are hurt or fall ill every year in the workplace—incidents that are often preventable. On the 50th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, we reflect on the workers who have tragically lost their lives or have been harmed in the workplace, and we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that every American worker has a safe and healthy work environment.
        <PRTPAGE P="90"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Over the past century, labor unions have fought hard—very often successfully—to draw attention to unsafe workplace environments and organize for safer work conditions and protections from the Federal Government. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act codified private-sector workers' right to organize, collectively bargain, and strike. Decades later, the passage of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act in 1969 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1970 enshrined a promise that the wanton indifference to workers' lives—the days of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and the Farmington Mine explosion—would no longer be tolerated. Establishing and enforcing Federal workplace safety and health standards has undoubtedly saved lives.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the progress we have made cementing workplace protections into law, many workers still fear retaliation and retribution from management when they are asked to perform unsafe tasks or work in unsanitary conditions. This fear forces many workers to remain silent, putting their lives and the lives of their colleagues at risk. Alone, a single worker is often at the mercy of their boss, with little chance of rectifying an unsafe working environment created by employers who cut corners in the name of profit. United, and protected by law from intimidation and coercion from their employers, workers can collectively demand improved working conditions.</FP>
    <FP>In an economic system that puts too much power in the hands of wealthy corporations and Wall Street, unions give workers a way to band together, wield their full power, and stand on equal footing with management. Unions not only protect the physical wellbeing of workers, but they also protect their financial security; they protect workers' equity, too, helping ensure that workplaces are free from harassment and discrimination. Over the past half century, we have seen the percentage of American workers represented by unions decline dramatically. It is no surprise that during this same period, the average incomes of the bottom 90 percent of households in America have only risen by about 1 percent. The decades-long assault we've seen on union organizing is a direct assault on the health and incomes of American workers.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to protecting the lives, rights, and livelihoods of workers and reducing workplace accidents, injuries, and fatalities. That is why I strongly encourage the Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021—and why I included the PRO Act as part of my American Jobs Plan. The decision to form a union should belong to workers alone—free from coercion, interference, or intimidation—and this important legislation would empower workers to exercise their right to organize, hold management accountable for violating the rights of their workers, and promote union elections that are free from interference from employers.</FP>
    <FP>It is clear that we have not completely fulfilled our obligation to protect our Nation's workers. We must always remain vigilant against the notion that worker endangerment is simply a necessary cost of doing business. And we must always protect the right of workers to unite and bargain for their own mutual aid or protection.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, we mourn each treasured life taken away on the job. Those stricken by disease and fatal injuries as they keep America running deserve a dedicated day of grateful prayer and remembrance from the living. Workers Memorial Day impels us to work for a future where no one should have to

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>This May, during Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we recognize the history and achievements of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPIs) across our Nation. In the midst of a difficult year of pain and fear, we reflect on the tradition of leadership, resilience, and courage shown by AANHPI communities, and recommit to the struggle for AANHPI equity.</FP>
    <FP>Asian Americans, and Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders make our Nation more vibrant through diversity of cultures, languages, and religions. There is no single story of the AANHPI experience, but rather a diversity of contributions that enrich America's culture and society and strengthen the United States' role as a global leader. The American story as we know it would be impossible without the strength, contributions, and legacies of AANHPIs who have helped build and unite this country in each successive generation. From laying railroad tracks, tilling fields, and starting businesses, to caring for our loved ones and honorably serving our Nation in uniform, AANHPI communities are deeply rooted in the history of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>
        We also celebrate and honor the invaluable contributions the AANHPI communities have made to our Nation's culture and the arts, law, science and technology, sports and public service—including the courageous AANHPIs who have served on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic as health care providers, first responders, teachers, and other essential workers.
        <PRTPAGE P="92"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>During this year's Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month, our Nation celebrates the achievements of Vice President Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to hold the Office of the Vice President. Vice President Harris has blazed a trail and set an example for young people across the country to aspire to follow, including members of AANHPI communities and AANHPI women in particular.</FP>
    <FP>In spite of the strength shown and successes achieved, the American dream remains out of reach for far too many AANHPI families. AANHPI communities face systemic barriers to economic justice, health equity, educational attainment, and personal safety. These challenges are compounded by stark gaps in Federal data, which too often fails to reflect the diversity of AANHPI communities and the particular barriers that Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Southeast Asian, and South Asian communities in the United States continue to face.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration also recognizes the heightened fear felt by many Asian American communities in the wake of increasing rates of anti-Asian harassment and violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasingly observable layers of hate now directed toward women and elders of Asian descent in particular. Our Nation continues to grieve the senseless killings of six women of Asian descent in Atlanta, and the unconscionable acts of violence victimizing our beloved Asian American seniors in cities across the country.</FP>
    <FP>Acts of anti-Asian bias are wrong, they are un-American, and they must stop. My Administration will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with AANHPI communities in condemning, denouncing, and preventing these acts of violence. We will continue to look for opportunities to heal together and fight against the racism and xenophobia that still exists in this country.</FP>
    <FP>Present-day inequities faced by AANHPI communities are rooted in our Nation's history of exclusion, discrimination, racism, and xenophobia against Asian Americans. Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders have endured a long history of injustice—including the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the incarceration of Japanese American citizens during World War II, the murder of Vincent Chin, the mass shooting of Southeast Asian refugee children in 1989, and the targeting of South Asian Americans, especially those who are Muslim, Hindu, or Sikh, after the national tragedy of 9/11. It is long past time for Federal leadership to advance inclusion, belonging, and acceptance for all AANHPI communities. My Administration is committed to a whole-of-government effort to advance equity, root out racial injustices in our Federal institutions, and finally deliver the promise of America for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>Vice President Harris and I affirm that Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders make our Nation stronger. I urge my fellow Americans to join us this month in celebrating AANHPI history, people, and cultures.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2021 as Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Jewish American Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The Jewish American experience is a story of faith, fortitude, and progress. It is a quintessential American experience—one that is connected to key tenets of American identity, including our Nation's commitment to freedom of religion and conscience. This month, we honor Jewish Americans—past and present—who have inextricably woven their experience and their accomplishments into the fabric of our national identity.</FP>
    <FP>Generations of Jewish people have come to this Nation fleeing oppression, discrimination, and persecution in search of a better life for themselves and their children. These Jewish Americans have created lives for themselves and their families and played indispensable roles in our Nation's civic and community life, making invaluable contributions to our Nation through their leadership and achievements.</FP>
    <FP>And this year, we also recognize two historic firsts, as America saw the Vice President take the oath of office alongside her Jewish spouse, and a Jewish American became the first Majority Leader of the United States Senate and the highest-ranking Jewish American elected official in our Nation's history.</FP>
    <FP>Alongside this narrative of achievement and opportunity, there is also a history—far older than the Nation itself—of racism, bigotry, and other forms of injustice. This includes the scourge of anti-Semitism. In recent years, Jewish Americans have increasingly been the target of white nationalism and the antisemitic violence it fuels.</FP>
    <FP>As our Nation strives to heal these wounds and overcome these challenges, let us acknowledge and celebrate the crucial contributions that Jewish Americans have made to our collective struggle for a more just and fair society; leading movements for social justice, working to ensure that the opportunities they have secured are extended to others, and heeding the words of the Torah, “Justice, justice shall you pursue.”</FP>
    <FP>A central concept in Judaism, “l'dor v'dor”, or “from generation to generation,” recognizes both the continuity of the Jewish people and the intergenerational responsibility we have to heal the world for our children. During Jewish American Heritage Month, we honor Jewish Americans, who, inspired by Jewish values and American ideals, have engaged in the ongoing work of forming a more perfect union.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Building Safety Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Throughout this past year, we have come to appreciate the contributions and complexity of our building and built environment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people saw their homes become more than a place of dwelling, evolving into a comprehensive space for education, work, childcare, and entertainment. During National Building Safety Month, we recognize the importance of strengthening our buildings and infrastructure to serve the needs and ensure the safety of every American. We also honor the building safety professionals dedicated to creating safe, sustainable, and resilient communities.</FP>
    <FP>We also recognize that now is the time to repair and modernize our buildings and infrastructure, not only to meet the needs of today, but to address the challenges of tomorrow, especially the existential threat of climate change. The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every one of us, but too often the brunt falls disproportionately on vulnerable communities—especially low-income communities and people of color—who are facing new and worsening natural hazards like hurricanes, floods, extreme heat, and wildfires due to climate change. These communities are less likely to have the means to prepare for and recover from these hazards, which have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity. The buildings where we live and work provide an important line of defense against these growing hazards. Investing in our infrastructure and adopting and implementing modern building codes are the most effective mitigation measures communities can undertake.</FP>
    <FP>This is why I have issued several Executive Orders related to buildings and resiliency as part of a Government-wide approach to the climate emergency. My Administration has also put the climate crisis at the center of U.S. foreign and national security policy, and established the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy and the National Climate Task Force. We are committed to creating climate-friendly and environmentally conscious communities that not only protect the people who live and work in them, but also will boost our economy in the long-term.</FP>
    <FP>
        In order for us to safeguard the health, safety, and economic future of our Nation's people, we must also invest in our infrastructure more broadly. 
        <PRTPAGE P="95"/>
        From upgrading homes in disadvantaged communities, to modernizing our Nation's schools, to replacing lead water pipes, to securing affordable, high-speed broadband, the American Jobs Plan is an investment for all Americans. It will create millions of good jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and promote access to opportunity for all.
    </FP>
    <FP>To support these efforts, my Administration is also calling for broad input and collaboration from all levels of government and our partners in the non-profit and private sectors. We must all share the responsibility for ensuring that our communities are safe and resilient against the growing threat of climate change. In America and around the globe, initiatives such as the Global Resiliency Dialogue aim to increase building and climate-based science into the solution. This important work is underway, but we recognize that there is much more to do.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2021 as National Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise awareness about building safety. I also call on all Americans to learn more about how they can contribute to building safety at home and in their communities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Foster Care Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every child deserves to grow up in a supportive, loving home where they can thrive and prosper. During those unfortunate times when children cannot remain safely in their own homes, the individuals and families who open their hearts and homes to foster children provide a vital service to their communities. During this National Foster Care Month, we share our gratitude for those who support youth and families by being a resource to children in need and supporting birth parents so that they may safely reunite with their families whenever possible. We also recognize that it takes collaboration and community effort—from local organizations to Federal agencies—to support children, birth parents, and resource and kin families during challenging times.</FP>
    <FP>
        Young people in foster care have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are navigating circumstances that are already tough, and those challenges are compounded by a public health crisis that made housing, employment and educational opportunities even harder to access.
        <PRTPAGE P="96"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>To support the immediate needs of youth in foster care, my Administration is implementing Federal programs authorized by the Supporting Foster Youth and Families through the Pandemic Act. This law provides additional flexibility and support for youth aging out of foster care, and allows them to access critical services to help them stay in school or participate in a job training program, pay the bills, and better make the difficult transition to adulthood. We have an expression in the Biden family, “If you have to ask for help, it's too late.” As a Nation, we can proactively help children by advancing a holistic approach to child and family well-being across the country—before it's too late.</FP>
    <FP>As we work to address immediate needs, we must be clear about long-standing challenges in child welfare and commit to advancing child and family well-being in every way we can. Our children, birth parents, and resource and kin families deserve nothing less. So this National Foster Care Month, we also recognize the histories of injustice in our Nation's foster care system. Throughout our history and persisting today, too many communities of color, especially Black and Native American communities, have been treated unequally and often unfairly by the child welfare system. Black and Native American children are far more likely than white children to be removed from their homes, even when the circumstances surrounding the removal are similar. Once removed, Black and Native American children stay in care longer and are less likely to either reunite with their birth parents or be adopted. Too many children are removed from loving homes because poverty is often conflated with neglect, and the enduring effects of systemic racism and economic barriers mean that families of color are disproportionately affected by this as well. Children with disabilities are over-represented among youth in care and may be inappropriately placed in group settings instead of provided the individualized support they need. Children in foster care—particularly youth of color and LGBTQ+ children who are already subject to disproportionate rates of school discipline and criminalization—are also at an increased risk of becoming involved in the juvenile justice system. And for LGBTQ+ foster youth, foster care systems are not always equipped to safely meet their needs.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to addressing these entrenched problems in our Nation's child welfare system, advancing equity and racial justice for every child and family who is touched by the foster care and child welfare system, and focusing on policies that improve child and family well-being. This is why my Administration's discretionary funding request for 2022 includes $100 million in competitive grants for State and local child welfare systems to advance racial equity and prevent unnecessary child removals.</FP>
    <FP>National Foster Care Month is an opportunity for us to celebrate the resource and kin families who are supporting children by opening their homes and sharing their love. Crucially, it is also an opportunity to celebrate foster youth and all of their accomplishments, and to celebrate and encourage the many biological parents who are working hard to safely reunite with their children. And it provides an opportunity for us to fulfill our responsibility as a Nation to take care of each other and provide our vulnerable youth and families with the support they need.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Mental health is essential to our overall health, and the importance of attending to mental health has become even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only negatively impacted many people's mental health but has also created barriers to treatment.</FP>
    <FP>Millions of adults and children across America experience mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a mental health condition. Those living with mental health conditions are our family, friends, classmates, neighbors, and coworkers. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could discriminate against people based on pre-existing conditions, including mental health conditions, and mental health and substance use services were not covered by insurance. Still discrimination against those with mental health conditions in our society remains, and can make it difficult to find and reach out for help. While our Nation has made progress in promoting mental health services, many communities face pervasive barriers in accessing mental health care.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis has impacted the mental health of millions of Americans. Isolation, sickness, grief, job loss, food instability, and loss of routines has increased the need for mental health services. At the same time, the need to protect people from COVID-19 has made it more challenging for people to access mental health services, and harder for providers to deliver this care.</FP>
    <FP>
        Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental health conditions in our Nation was on the rise. In 2019, nearly 52 million adults experienced some form of mental illness. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that one in four adults reported experiencing symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder in February 2021—a significant increase from the prior year. Youth mental health is also worsening, with nearly 10 percent of America's youth reporting severe depression. We must treat this as the public health crisis that it is and reverse this trend.
        <PRTPAGE P="98"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Too many people with mental health needs feel they have nowhere to turn. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States and the second leading cause of death for our Nation's youth today. Suicide rates are disproportionately high among Black youth, and LGBTQI+ persons are at disproportionate risk of death by suicide as well as suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts. My Administration is committed to advancing suicide prevention best practices and improving non-punitive crisis response. Even as we build and enhance existing systems for prevention and response within communities, immediate assistance is available for those in need of help by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or by calling 1-800-662-HELP.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to ensuring that people living with mental health conditions are treated with compassion, respect, and understanding. We must also address the disparities that underserved communities, especially communities of color, face and work to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality, and evidence-based mental health care.</FP>
    <FP>As President, I know that we can and must address these critical issues, especially for those who have shouldered the burden of standing on the front lines in responding to the pandemic. That is why the American Rescue Plan includes substantial investments to promote mental health among the health care workforce. We are also building on the progress made through the 21st Century Cures Act by integrating mental health and addiction treatment into primary care settings, schools, and homes.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is focused on building an improved, expanded system of care for the mental health needs of adults and children. This will require an increase in the number of mental health professionals. Building on a program in the American Rescue Plan, I have requested $1 billion in funding to expand the number of school-based mental health professionals, including school psychologists and counselors to address the mental health needs of students. The American Rescue Plan also delivered $3 billion for substance use and mental health care block grants. These funds also ensure that States provide pathways to prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery services—especially for underserved communities. The American Rescue Plan also included $420 million in funding to support Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics to expand access to high-quality, evidence-based behavioral health services. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics are also committed to involving peers and families, who are essential to mental health recovery.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to ensuring that everyone knows that they are not alone, that help exists, and that we will provide the mental health support needed to heal, recover, and thrive.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2021 as National Mental Health Awareness Month.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Despite the unprecedented challenges and disruptions of the past year, we continue to see examples of Americans finding innovative ways to stay active and healthy. Some have moved their workouts into their living rooms or garages. Others have taken up new sports. Many have simply rediscovered the satisfaction of a walk through their neighborhood. Despite this creativity, far too many people struggle to incorporate regular physical activity into their daily lives. Socioeconomic disparities, lack of opportunities for safe play, and limited access to programs for increased activity are just a few of the inequities that many Americans face—inequities that have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. During this National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we encourage all Americans to stay active for their health and wellbeing. Whether by pursuing a more active lifestyle, making physical activity a priority and an essential part of everyday living, or supporting efforts in local communities that increase access to sports and physical fitness opportunities for all, participating in physical activities leads to a healthier lifestyle.</FP>
    <FP>Physical activity is one of the best tools we have to help combat chronic diseases experienced by over half of all Americans. Even a single session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can boost your mood, sharpen your focus, reduce your stress, and improve your sleep. More regular physical activity—over months or years—can contribute to a reduced risk of depression, heart disease, several types of cancer, dementia, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.</FP>
    <FP>
        No matter our age or ability, the more that we can make regular physical activity and participation in sports a part of our lives, the better off both we and our Nation will be. Greater amounts of physical activity can have positive effects in every stage of life and lead to better overall health outcomes for both children and adults, including those with disabilities. The Department of Health and Human Services' Move Your Way campaign provides helpful tips to encourage children and adults to meet the recommendations from the 
        <E T="03">Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.</E>
         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Active People, Healthy Nation initiative provides a blueprint for building active communities to make it easier for all Americans to attain the physical activity they need, with a goal of getting 27 million more Americans physically active by 2027.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        By transcending differences and uniting in celebration of physical activity, healthy competition, and shared enjoyment, sports are a fun and engaging way to stay active and keep fit for people of all ages. For our Nation's 
        <PRTPAGE P="100"/>
        youth, playing sports can also help to build confidence on and off the field, while team sports foster the added virtues of service to common causes and communal responsibility—win or lose, every game offers the opportunity to learn something new or hone your skills. Every athletic challenge is an avenue to greater mental and physical resilience. While social distancing has made participation in organized sports challenging, we can use this time to renew our focus on fundamental skills and training in preparation for a return to play, especially for young athletes.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation can and must do more to make sure that every child has the opportunity to play sports and obtain the benefits that come with play, including greater physical fitness and better health. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever that we ensure equal access to sports and fitness activities for everyone. To that end, my Administration continues to promote programs that provide opportunities for all of our young people to play sports—regardless of their race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, or neighborhood—in support of the 
        <E T="03">National Youth Sports Strategy.</E>
    </FP>
    <FP>I encourage every American to discover an enjoyable exercise activity that fits into their daily routine. It does not matter how you choose to be active—whether you are trying your hand at a new sport, exploring a local park, or going for a walk or a jog in your own neighborhood, physical activity holds the key to better health and wellness. During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, let us all strive to be more active together.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2021 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        As the proud husband of an educator who continues, as First Lady, to teach writing at a community college, I have seen firsthand the dedication, selflessness, and vision of our Nation's educators. They play so many different roles: They are mentors who guide with creativity and care; advocates who fight for students' needs; role models who help students dream and dare more boldly; and leaders who tirelessly support the families and 
        <PRTPAGE P="101"/>
        communities that depend on them. Every day, with every student they reach, educators build the future of our country, and we are grateful for their commitment to our shared future. This National Teacher Appreciation Day and National Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor the service and passion and celebrate the immeasurable contributions of our Nation's educators in schools from coast to coast.
    </FP>
    <FP>Throughout history, America's educators have risen to unprecedented challenges. Over the past year, with our country facing a cascade of crises, educators have risen to this challenge with care and creativity: overcoming disruptions in their own lives while offering unwavering support for their students' wellbeing and academic progress.</FP>
    <FP>Educators served both as facilitators of learning and as the technology support for their students, getting them up and running with access to fully remote learning. They often worked late into the day to support hard-to-reach children, and took the extracurriculars their students love and adapted them for remote and hybrid learning. Our teachers even found new ways to leverage technology platforms to coordinate with parents as partners in learning, keep a close eye on the development of their students, and build community by moving music rehearsals and sports practices online.</FP>
    <FP>As this pandemic has shined a bright light on the inequities that persist in our schools, educators have also fought for the tools and resources their schools need to bridge gaps and ensure all children have what they need to succeed. Other school staff and administrators have also stepped up in our time of need, with bus drivers bringing hotspots to areas with no wireless internet, food service staff preparing meals for students who might otherwise go hungry, and counselors helping students and parents cope with trauma.</FP>
    <FP>When I took office, I vowed to support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. I made a promise that they would not only have a voice as we work to rebuild and reimagine our education system, they would help us lead this effort. That is why my Administration is partnering with State and local leaders, educators and their unions, and families to ensure high-quality instruction, overcome the challenges of the instructional time we lost in the pandemic, address educational inequities, and meet students' physical, social, and emotional needs.</FP>
    <FP>In early March, I prioritized early childhood through 12th grade educators and staff for vaccination, and I set a goal of getting all of these frontline essential workers at least one shot by the end of the month. On April 2nd, I announced that 80 percent of all teachers, school staff, and childcare workers across the country had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Since then, we have made even more progress in protecting our educators.</FP>
    <FP>
        The American Rescue Plan is providing critical relief, including $122 billion in relief for K-12 schools to get students back in the classroom quickly and safely and address the needs of students. In addition, the American Rescue Plan includes $7.6 billion for special education, children and youth experiencing homelessness, Tribal educational agencies, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives, emergency assistance to non-public schools, and the outlying areas of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as $40 billion for higher education.

    <FP>Education is the one field that makes all others possible. Every one of us has been shaped by someone who inspired our curiosity and helped us find our confidence, who guided us to think more clearly and pushed us to strive for better. On National Teacher Appreciation Day and during National Teacher Appreciation Week, we remember the tremendous debt of gratitude owed to educators everywhere who helped define us as individuals and as a country, and to all that they are doing to light the way forward for our families and our communities.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4, 2021, as National Teacher Appreciation Day and May 2 through May 8, 2021, as National Teacher Appreciation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the hard work and dedication of our Nation's teachers and to observe this day and this week by supporting teachers through appropriate activities, events, and programs.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Public Service Recognition Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the face of unprecedented challenges this past year, America's dedicated public servants have risen to the moment—bringing strength, healing, and hope to their communities and to our Nation. Our public servants are a living reminder that, here in America, we take care of one another and leave no one behind. As we work to defeat the pandemic and rebuild our economy, it is more important than ever to recognize and reflect upon both our collective loss and our collective resilience. During Public Service Recognition Week, we celebrate and thank our public servants at the local, State, and Federal levels who exemplify dedication to the common good.</FP>
    <FP>Public servants are the lifeblood of our democracy. They are our researchers and scientists, our front-line workers, our educators, our first responders, our election officials, and our military service members—among countless others. They are ordinary Americans who answer the call to do extraordinary things, giving their time—and, in some cases, risking or giving their lives—to make life better for all of us.</FP>
    <FP>
        Throughout this week and beyond, my Administration will be shining a light on the individual and collective efforts of public servants at the local, State, Tribal, and Federal levels who unite us and help lead us through challenging times. In the toughest of circumstances and often at great personal sacrifice, our public servants tackle the most complex problems facing our communities. Whether developing public health guidance and 
        <PRTPAGE P="103"/>
        working across agencies to safely reopen schools during the pandemic, partnering with the private sector to develop and distribute vaccines, keeping small businesses dreams alive, or combating natural disasters in their hometowns, public servants demonstrate their commitment to our Nation every day. It is our responsibility, in turn, to ensure that they are honored and protected.
    </FP>
    <FP>Since taking office earlier this year, I have made it the policy of the United States to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce. My Administration made employee safety a priority—directing agencies to create COVID-19 workplace safety plans and require mask-wearing, physical distancing, and other public health measures in Federal buildings and on Federal lands. I revoked several Executive Orders that undermined the foundations of civil service, worked to ensure the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining, and created a new interagency task force to ensure that Federal employees engaged in scientific research and data collection are never subjected to political interference.</FP>
    <FP>In addition, I have strengthened protections against discrimination for Federal employees, including discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. I have also asked the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to provide me with recommendations to promote a $15 per hour minimum wage for Federal employees, as well as recommendations for expanding the Federal Government's policy of providing employees time off to vote. And this week, I signed an Executive Order that will increase the minimum wage for employees working on Federal contracts to $15 per hour.</FP>
    <FP>Together, as we strive to build, support, and continuously improve our public workforce, we recognize and celebrate the indispensable contributions our public servants make while protecting our communities, taking care of our neighbors, and helping us heal and build back better. It is the honor of my lifetime to serve our Nation alongside our public servants, who work tirelessly to improve the lives of Americans and people around the globe.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2 through May 8, 2021, as Public Service Recognition Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate public servants and their contributions this week and throughout the year.</FP>

    <EAR>Proc. 10197</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Law Day, U.S.A., 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the many years I spent as a United States Senator and as Vice President, I logged hundreds of thousands of miles of travel, and had the opportunity to meet with foreign officials all over the world. Those experiences impressed upon me a truth about America: that what makes our Nation unique is the depth of our devotion to the rule of law.</FP>
    <FP>Unlike so many of the Nations of the world, the United States wasn't built around an ethnicity, religion, or tribe—it was built around common ideals. The rule of law is central to those ideals. It is what limits the abuse of power in our Nation, whether by an individual or a mob. It reflects President John Adams' desire to establish “a government of laws and not of men.” It is how Thomas Paine distinguished us from the rest of the world—declaring that, while in other Nations, the king is law, “in America, the law is king.”</FP>
    <FP>Many Nations around the world still struggle to capture what we have captured here in America—not only in the text of our founding documents, but in the character of our people: reverence for the law. That reverence is essential to our democracy. Without it, equality and justice cannot be advanced, human rights cannot be protected, democratic norms and values cannot be secured, and disagreements cannot be peaceably resolved. The rule of law has also been a critical vehicle for delivering the full promise of American democracy to all of our people, particularly those excluded in our Nation's founding. Today, on Law Day, we rededicate ourselves to furthering that promise and strengthening those ideals, and we renew our commitment to ensure that every American's constitutional rights are protected.</FP>
    <FP>The theme of this year's Law Day, “Advancing the Rule of Law Now,” is particularly fitting at this moment in our Nation's history. Recently, we were again called to recognize that democracy is precious and fragile. We have witnessed grave threats to our democratic institutions and to the rule of law itself. These tragic events have taught us once again that when we are united, we can overcome the greatest challenges and move our country forward—but it takes a commitment to law over demagoguery, and the enforcement of law free from political interference, to do so.</FP>
    <FP>
        Previous generations of Americans have lived through civil war, economic depressions, the rise of fascism, and world wars—and today, too many Americans continue to face pervasive racism, xenophobia, nativism, and other forms of intolerance. This year, the United States marks the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa, Oklahoma, race massacre, in which a mob of white residents attacked and killed between 100 and 300 Black residents and destroyed more than 1,000 homes and businesses in a thriving community known as Black Wall Street. Today, a century later, we still face chilling echoes of those threats to equality, justice, and the rule of law in the form of rising political extremism, white supremacy, and domestic terrorism.
        <PRTPAGE P="105"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to advancing the rule of law within the United States so that everyone is ensured equal justice under the law, an equal place in our democracy, and the opportunity to fulfill their potential free from abuses of power. On my first day in office, I signed an historic Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, to advance equity and racial justice and redress systemic racism across a comprehensive sweep of Federal policies, laws, and programs. I also signed a memorandum on Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, stating that the Federal Government has a responsibility to prevent racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against anyone in the United States—particularly, today, against Asian Americans who have spent the last year enduring unconscionable and un-American harassment and attacks—as well as an additional Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. I have directed Federal agencies to facilitate access to voting using their existing legal authority, and my Administration supports further legislation to protect the sacred right to vote and make it more equitable and accessible for all Americans to exercise that right.</FP>
    <FP>We are also working to advance the rule of law across the world by rebuilding global alliances; confronting authoritarianism; and reengaging with other governments, civil society organizations, and multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations. We must ensure that we are able to lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. As I have said on many occasions, our diplomacy must be rooted in America's most cherished democratic values: defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person with dignity.</FP>
    <FP>On this Law Day, U.S.A., I urge my fellow Americans to join me in recommitting ourselves to promoting and advancing the rule of law and delivering freedom and equality for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2021, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Loyalty Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On Loyalty Day, we celebrate our allegiance to the project of this great Nation and the democratic ideals woven into the fabric of our Constitution. As Americans, we do not command loyalty, but seek to earn it through our actions—including by living up to the principles enshrined in our Constitution and respecting the will of the people as reflected in the democratic process. Drawn together by the promise of equality, freedom, and justice, we are a Nation of shared ideals and strong, resilient people. Here in America, loyalty does not mean fealty to any one leader or political party, nor does it mean unthinking praise or willful ignorance of our shortcomings—it means loyalty to our common ideals, and to one another. It means standing united as one people, even as we cherish our differences and respect dissent.</FP>
    <FP>Our country is a diverse tapestry of many cultures, heritages, religions, and languages, brought together around the values and ideals we all share as Americans. Together, we celebrate our differences and draw strength from our common commitment to perfecting our Union. No matter what challenges come our way, our Nation holds strong together—bound by our Constitution and the rule of law, uplifted by individual liberties and promises of justice we have worked hard in each generation to secure and expand, and consecrated by those who have sacrificed to preserve, defend, and care for our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>We see loyalty in the members of our Armed Forces, who selflessly serve in harm's way; in their families, who, in the timeless words of the poet John Milton, “also serve who only stand and wait;” in our educators, who dedicate their lives to nurturing young minds; in our first responders, who put their lives on the line to save others; in all those who have the courage to call out our Nation's imperfections when we fall short, and who continue to push our society to live up to its founding promise of freedom, justice, and equality for all. May 1 is also International Workers' Day, and we honor the workers whose service and sacrifice has helped turn the tide against the COVID-19 pandemic. On this day, we show our gratitude to our essential workers—and to all of the workers who have organized and fought to improve our Nation and create a fairer and more just society for all.</FP>
    <FP>To acknowledge the American ethos of patriotism and the sacrifices so many of our fellow citizens have made, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated the 1st day of May each year as Loyalty Day. On this day, let us reaffirm our commitment to the values that bind us together and honor all those who have defended our freedom.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2021, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty Day, I call upon the people of the United States to join in this national observance, display the United States flag and pledge allegiance to the Republic for which it stands.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Suspension of Entry as Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus Disease 2019By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The national emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security. As of April 29, 2021, the United States had experienced more than 32 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 570,000 COVID-19 deaths. It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to act swiftly and aggressively to prevent further spread of the disease.</FP>
    <FP>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, has determined that the Republic of India is experiencing widespread, ongoing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has reported that the Republic of India has had more than 18,375,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The magnitude and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of India is surging; the Republic of India accounts for over one-third of new global cases, and the number of new cases in the Republic of India is accelerating at a rapid rate. There have been more than 300,000 average new daily cases in the Republic of India over the past week. A variant strain of the virus, known as B.1.617, is also circulating in the Republic of India, along with other variant strains, including B.1.1.7, first detected in the United Kingdom, and B.1.351, first detected in the Republic of South Africa. The CDC advises, based on work by public health and scientific experts, that these variants have characteristics of concern, which may make them more easily transmitted and have the potential for reduced protection afforded by some vaccines.</FP>
    <FP>After reviewing the public health situation within the Republic of India, CDC has concluded that proactive measures are required to protect the Nation's public health from travelers entering the United States from that jurisdiction.</FP>
    <FP>
        Given the determination of CDC, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, described above, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as nonimmigrants, of noncitizens of the United States (“noncitizens”) who were physically present within the

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>During Older Americans Month, we celebrate older Americans and the key role they play in sharing the wisdom and experience that inform today's decisions and actions, and fostering the connection and engagement that build strong, resilient communities. And, we recognize our responsibility to ensure that every American has the opportunity to age with dignity.</FP>
    <FP>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed tremendous hardships on our Nation's older Americans. Older adults—particularly those from communities of color—have comprised the majority of deaths from COVID-19, with more than 80 percent of all deaths to date occurring in persons 65 and older. Many older Americans have also suffered extreme social isolation from being separated from friends, family, and community resources throughout the pandemic. In spite of this, older Americans have stepped up to support their families, friends, and neighbors. They are among our essential workers, volunteers, and donors, bolstering their communities and inspiring others to do the same. I am committed to ensuring older adults are central in our country's recovery efforts.
        <PRTPAGE P="111"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration recognizes the value of our older adults and supports the issues most important to them, such as Medicare, Social Security, lowering the price of prescription drugs, and long-term care options—including Medicaid's home and community-based services programs. The American Rescue Plan puts the needs of older Americans at the forefront of our country's path to recovery, starting by mounting a national vaccination program to quickly and efficiently deliver lifesaving vaccines, prioritizing our older citizens.</FP>
    <FP>The American Rescue Plan also provides much needed support to skilled nursing facilities, so they can improve infection control and vaccination rollout capability by partnering with quality improvement organizations. The law allocates funding to support mitigation, clinical care, infection control, and staffing in long-term care facilities during the pandemic. The law also provides significant funding to support older adults who receive home and community-based services through Medicaid to help them remain safe and independent in their own homes and communities throughout the pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>And, the American Rescue Plan adds substantial funding to programs authorized under the Older Americans Act. These programs also connect older adults and their caregivers to food, health care, and other home and community-based services. The American Rescue Plan also calls for the establishment of the National Technical Assistance Center on Grandfamilies and Kinship Families, to give much needed aid to those older Americans who have stepped up to parent the next generation of Americans. Finally, the plan enhances the Elder Justice Act and ensures Adult Protective Services can be used to protect the safety of all adults as they age.</FP>
    <FP>As our country works to put COVID-19 behind us, we know there is more we must do to ensure that older Americans can live and age with dignity. We are committed to ensuring older Americans can easily access appropriate services they need to stay safe and healthy as they age.</FP>
    <FP>In this year of peril and promise, older Americans have suffered greatly, and provided inspirational demonstrations of strength.

    <EAR>Proc. 10201</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">60th Anniversary of the Freedom Rides, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On May 4, 1961, thirteen Americans set out on Greyhound and Trailways buses from Washington, DC, to peacefully protest the scourge of segregation. They came from 9 different States and the District of Columbia; they were Black and white, men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 61, sitting side by side in a simple affirmation of shared humanity. They were teachers and students, carpenters and architects, ministers and servicemembers. Frances and Walter Bergman, Albert Bigelow, Ed Blankenheim, Reverend Benjamin Elton Cox, James Farmer, Genevieve Hughes, Jimmy McDonald, James Peck, Joe Perkins, Charles Person, Hank Thomas, and a 21-year-old student at the American Baptist Theological Seminary named John Lewis.</FP>
    <FP>By the time of the first Freedom Rides, Thurgood Marshall and other heroes of the early Civil Rights Movement had already persuaded the Supreme Court to strike down the devastating doctrine of 'separate but equal,' which had given legal cover to the horrors of Jim Crow for more than half a century. But for far too many Americans, that promise of equality was slow to arrive. As their buses arrived in each segregated town, the Riders were brutally attacked by vicious, hateful mobs of white supremacists. They were kicked and beaten unconscious, assaulted with bats and batons, and arrested under laws that had already been declared illegal by the Supreme Court—but which festered nevertheless. One of the two buses had its tires slashed and windows smashed before it was firebombed.</FP>
    <FP>The Freedom Riders remained devoted to nonviolence, displaying extraordinary physical courage and unflinching moral conviction. Despite the brutality they faced, they were joined by five other Riders along the route, and then by hundreds more joining similar rides in the months to come. The public attention they brought to a pernicious cancer in our society further inspired millions of Americans across the country, including generations of Americans who have continued the fight for civil rights in the years since. Their message of bravery, hope, and unity in diversity continues to inspire us.</FP>
    <FP>John Lewis was the first to withstand a physical attack, just 6 days into the trip. It was not his first act of courageous leadership and sacrifice, nor his last. Across his lifetime of service in and out of Government, John Lewis was the moral compass of our Nation—though he absorbed the force of human nature's cruelty, he emanated dignity and grace. On the anniversary of his journey on the Freedom Rides, I am reminded of the message he shared with me before he passed away last summer: that we must stay focused on the work left undone to heal this Nation. It is a call to all Americans to follow the example he set.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is committed to advancing the values and aspirations of John Lewis and the Freedom Riders. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order establishing a comprehensive initiative to address racial equity and redress systemic racism in Federal policies, laws, and programs. I also signed a Memorandum stating that the Federal Government 
        <PRTPAGE P="113"/>
        has a responsibility to prevent racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against anyone in the United States—as well as an additional Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. I have directed Federal agencies to preserve and strengthen the sacred right to vote using their existing legal authority. My Administration also supports further legislation to protect that most fundamental right—to make our democracy more equitable and accessible for all Americans, and to enact a new Voting Rights Act in John Lewis's name.
    </FP>
    <FP>Today, we honor the Freedom Riders who took a stand against injustice 60 years ago. And we are inspired by the power and purpose of a dedicated few who helped spark a movement—to make us a better Nation, and to build a more perfect union for all of us.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4, 2021, as the 60th Anniversary of the Freedom Rides. I call upon all Americans to participate in ceremonies and activities that honor the Freedom Riders, those who struggled for equal rights during the Civil Rights Movement, and those working still to advance civil rights across the Nation.</FP>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, thousands of unsolved cases of missing and murdered Native Americans continue to cry out for justice and healing. On Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, we remember the Indigenous people who we have lost to murder and those who remain missing and commit to working with Tribal Nations to ensure any instance of a missing or murdered person is met with swift and effective action.</FP>
    <FP>Our failure to allocate the necessary resources and muster the necessary commitment to addressing and preventing this ongoing tragedy not only demeans the dignity and humanity of each person who goes missing or is murdered, it sends pain and shockwaves across our Tribal communities. Our treaty and trust responsibilities to Tribal Nations require our best efforts, and our concern for the well-being of these fellow citizens require us to act with urgency. To this end, our Government must strengthen its support and collaboration with Tribal communities.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is fully committed to working with Tribal Nations to address the disproportionately high number of missing or murdered Indigenous people, as well as increasing coordination to investigate and resolve 
        <PRTPAGE P="114"/>
        these cases and ensure accountability. I am further committed to addressing the underlying causes behind those numbers, including—among others—sexual violence, human trafficking, domestic violence, violent crime, systemic racism, economic disparities, and substance use and addiction. Federal partnerships to address the number of missing and murdered Indigenous peoples will be governed by the Nation-to-Nation foundation of our relationship with Tribal governments and respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. The challenges in Tribal communities are best met by solutions that are informed and shaped by Tribal leaders and Tribal governments.
    </FP>
    <FP>Tribes across the United States have long worked to provide solutions for their communities. In April, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Indian Reservation, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Montana, and the FBI announced the Nation's first Tribal Community Response Plan, part of a Department of Justice pilot project to address emergent missing person cases in their community. When someone goes missing, it is often an urgent and time-sensitive situation. The Tribal community response plan lays out a blueprint for how Tribal law enforcement; local, State, and Federal law enforcement; and community members can respond when someone goes missing from a Tribal community—resolving important issues of jurisdictional overlap and gaps in order to respond swiftly and effectively. Other Tribes and Native villages such as the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma, Native Village of Unalakleet in Alaska, and the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan, are working with Federal partners on their own community response plans.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration has made a priority of helping to solve the issues surrounding Native Americans who go missing and those who are murdered across the United States—including high rates of Native women and girls, including transgender women and girls. We recognize there is a level of mistrust of the United States Government in many Native communities, stemming from a long history of broken promises, oppression, and trauma. That is why we are pursuing ways to build trust in our Government and the systems designed to provide support to families in need. We must bridge the gap for families in crisis, provide necessary support services, and support opportunities for healing through holistic community-driven approaches.</FP>
    <FP>I am committed to building on the successes of the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) by supporting the passage of the VAWA Reauthorization of 2021. Among other protections, this bill reaffirms inherent Tribal authority to prosecute certain non-Indian offenders—extending protections from domestic violence and dating violence to Native American victims of sexual violence, stalking, trafficking, child abuse, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement or justice personnel when crimes are committed on Tribal territory. Additionally, through the American Rescue Plan we provided an additional $35 million in grants for Tribes to provide temporary housing, assistance, and supportive services to victims of domestic and dating violence, as well as supplemental funding for the StrongHearts Native Helpline, and additional funding for services for sexual assault survivors.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration has also committed to effectively implement the requirements of Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act, legislation focused 
        <PRTPAGE P="115"/>
        on combating the issues surrounding missing or murdered Indigenous persons. The Presidential Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives continues to convene the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Health and Human Services, to address the issues from a combined public health-public safety partnership. Furthering the efforts of the task force, the White House Council on Native American Affairs will bring together all relevant Federal agencies to work with Tribal Nations on exploring additional ways to enhance prevention efforts and improve access to safety and justice.
    </FP>
    <FP>Furthermore, informed by Tribal input, the Department of the Interior recently established the Missing &amp; Murdered Unit (MMU) within the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services to provide leadership and direction for cross-departmental and interagency work involving missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives. The MMU will help bring the weight of the Federal Government to bear when investigating these cases and marshal law enforcement resources across Federal agencies and throughout Indian country.</FP>
    <FP>Our commitment to addressing these issues and to strengthening these critical partnerships is unwavering. For too long, there has been too much sorrow and worry. United by our mutual investment in healthy, safe communities, we will work together to achieve lasting progress.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2021, as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day. I call on all Americans and ask all levels of government to support Tribal governments and Tribal communities' efforts to increase awareness of the issue of missing and murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives through appropriate programs and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Day of Prayer, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Throughout our history, Americans of many religions and belief systems have turned to prayer for strength, hope, and guidance. Prayer has nourished countless souls and powered moral movements—including essential fights against racial injustice, child labor, and infringement on the rights of disabled Americans. Prayer is also a daily practice for many, whether it is to ask for help or strength, or to give thanks over blessings bestowed.</FP>
    <FP>
        The First Amendment to our Constitution protects the rights of free speech and religious liberty, including the right of all Americans to pray. These 
        <PRTPAGE P="116"/>
        freedoms have helped us to create and sustain a Nation of remarkable religious vitality and diversity across the generations.
    </FP>
    <FP>Today, we remember and celebrate the role that the healing balm of prayer can play in our lives and in the life of our Nation. As we continue to confront the crises and challenges of our time—from a deadly pandemic, to the loss of lives and livelihoods in its wake, to a reckoning on racial justice, to the existential threat of climate change—Americans of faith can call upon the power of prayer to provide hope and uplift us for the work ahead. As the late Congressman John Lewis once said, “Nothing can stop the power of a committed and determined people to make a difference in our society. Why? Because human beings are the most dynamic link to the divine on this planet.”</FP>
    <FP>On this National Day of Prayer, we unite with purpose and resolve, and recommit ourselves to the core freedoms that helped define and guide our Nation from its earliest days. We celebrate our incredible good fortune that, as Americans, we can exercise our convictions freely—no matter our faith or beliefs. Let us find in our prayers, however they are delivered, the determination to overcome adversity, rise above our differences, and come together as one Nation to meet this moment in history.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a “National Day of Prayer.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2021, as a National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I join all people of faith in prayers for spiritual guidance, mercy, and protection.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        As the members of our Armed Forces safeguard our Nation at home and around the world, they depend on the people they love for strength, comfort, joy, and stability. Military spouses may not always wear a uniform, but they serve and sacrifice alongside their service members and keep our military strong. On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we recognize and thank the military spouses who serve our Nation and are critical to our national security.
        <PRTPAGE P="117"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Military families are proud of the lives they build. Spouses understand that loving a service member means facing the challenges that can accompany their service: from leaving friends behind to changing jobs again; making parenting decisions alone to losing sleep at night; deployments to homecomings to more deployments. Those challenges have been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to lost income, fewer childcare options, and extended deployments. Still, military spouses have done what they do best: adapt, persevere, and keep going.</FP>
    <FP>When someone you love is hurting, you hurt with them. When your spouse is at home, trying to make ends meet, or is torn between taking care of your children and keeping a job, your heart breaks too. Service members cannot focus on their mission if their families do not have what they need to thrive at home, and we cannot expect to retain even the most dedicated service members if they are forced to choose between their love of country and the hopes and dreams they have for their families. That is why supporting military spouses is critical to keeping our Nation safe.</FP>
    <FP>On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we recognize the importance of empowering spouses and ensuring they have the necessary tools and resources to thrive in all facets of their lives, including in the community, in the workforce, and at home.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is dedicated to supporting our Nation's military spouses. Through the First Lady's work with 
        <E T="03">Joining Forces,</E>

        <E T="03">Joining Forces,</E>
         the Department of Defense's Military Spouse Employment Partnership now includes more than 500 companies, nonprofit organizations, and Federal agencies that are committed to recruiting, hiring, promoting, and retaining military spouses. Since its inception, the Partnership has supported more than 180,000 military spouses. 
        <E T="03">Joining Forces</E>
         will continue to convene and collaborate with Federal agency partners, nonprofit organizations, corporate stakeholders, and service providers to develop comprehensive, meaningful, and long-term solutions to address the holistic well-being of military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. And, 
        <E T="03">Joining Forces</E>
         calls upon on all Americans to support and harness the special skills, strengths, and experiences of military spouses.
    </FP>
    <FP>Today, we pause to salute the women and men who do so much to support our troops, invest in our communities, and sacrifice for our country. Their strength and resilience are essential to the recruitment, retention, and readiness of our fighting forces and, indeed, to the strength of our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2021, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In 2020, the United States experienced a record year for extreme weather, with an unprecedented 30 named storms in the Atlantic Basin alone. Twelve of these storms, six of which were hurricanes, made landfall in the United States. These storms and hurricanes unleashed their devastating power on the individuals and communities in their paths. Their frequency and impact also highlight the existential threat posed to our Nation by climate change. During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we encourage all Americans living in potentially affected areas to take precautions to ensure that they, their families, and their communities are best prepared for hurricanes, and commit to improving our resilience to climate-related catastrophes.</FP>
    <FP>The costs exacted by these storms, in lives, livelihoods, and property damage, are staggering. Seven of last year's 30 named storms claimed 86 lives and caused $40 billion dollars in damage. Over the past two decades, tropical storms and hurricanes have taken over 6,000 lives in the United States and caused $853 billion in damage. These storms accounted for 60 percent of the costs of our most damaging weather events. In addition to the highly-visible damage, hurricanes also exact an unseen and long-lasting emotional toll; the trauma of a lost loved one, the sadness of losing treasured possessions, the stress of a financial setback. This is compounded for low-income communities and communities of color who are more likely to live in areas that make them vulnerable to flooding and other climate-related weather events, and less likely to have the funds to prepare for and recover from extreme weather events.</FP>
    <FP>As changes in our climate lead to additional extreme weather events, we must pursue research and resilience policies that keep us safe and strengthen our resilience.</FP>
    <FP>Since taking office, I have directed my Administration to put the climate crisis and the communities most vulnerable to it at the center of our domestic and foreign policy. This includes investing in weather forecasting and climate research to bolster our understanding of how our changing climate is altering the behavior of hurricanes, as well as ensuring every community has the resources to prepare for and respond to these changing storms. Although hurricanes cannot be prevented, we can predict and prepare for them.</FP>
    <FP>
        We are constantly improving our forecasts and communications with the public about the dangers posed by hurricanes. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasters work around the clock and collaborate with State, local, Tribal, and territorial emergency managers and government officials to provide actionable information before, during, and after a hurricane. NOAA also collaborates with key decision makers in Federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Such collaborative work ensures that communities standing in a storm's path have the information 
        <PRTPAGE P="119"/>
        and resources they need to adequately prepare. After the storm, NOAA provides stakeholders with essential information for damage assessments and to re-open ports and coastal waterways critical to our Nation's commerce.
    </FP>
    <FP>In addition to work being done by Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments, Americans should prepare themselves before a hurricane hits. Keep up with weather forecasts and have an evacuation kit prepared in case you ever need to relocate in advance of a hurricane. More information and preparedness plan templates are available from FEMA's ready.gov website.</FP>
    <FP>Everyone has a role to play in hurricane preparedness and making us a Weather-Ready Nation. When hurricanes strike, that's how we will save lives, lessen the damage to our homes, communities, and infrastructure, and recover stronger and faster.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 9 through May 15, 2021, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I urge all Americans to help build our Weather-Ready Nation, so that individuals are empowered and organizations can fulfill leadership roles in their communities. I call on our Federal, State, Tribal, territorial and local government agencies to share information that will protect lives and property.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Women's Health Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>It's a simple proposition for me: women are entitled to the same rights and opportunities as men, including access to high-quality, affordable health care. National Women's Health Week is an opportunity to focus on the work we need to do as a Nation to ensure equal access to high-quality, affordable care for women, and to build a more prosperous, healthy future for all.</FP>
    <FP>This starts by strengthening the Affordable Care Act, which ensures that women cannot be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions, such as pregnancy, or charged more for coverage simply because they are women. The Affordable Care Act also expanded coverage to millions of women who were previously uninsured, and made various preventive services available free of charge, including Pap smears and mammograms. In addition, it covers screening and counseling for domestic and intimate partner violence.</FP>
    <FP>
        To cover more Americans, the Biden-Harris Administration began a special open enrollment period on healthcare.gov, so that women who are uninsured have the opportunity to sign up for coverage through August 15. 
        <PRTPAGE P="120"/>
        And, we are committed to building on the successes of this law to make coverage more affordable. The American Rescue Plan, enacted earlier this year, will save women buying coverage on their own $50 per month on their health care premiums.
    </FP>
    <FP>The theme of this year's National Women's Health Week is “Ending the Pandemic and Elevating Women's Health.” The quickest and most effective way to defeat this pandemic and restore public health is through vaccination.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to advancing women's health and ensuring an equitable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have prioritized and increased access to the COVID-19 vaccine and expanded the criteria for eligibility to include all adults over the age of 16. We encourage women to talk to their doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants about the COVID-19 vaccine.</FP>
    <FP>And, it is important for women and girls to catch up on any missed vaccines or medical care from this past year. Delays in routine care—such as Pap smears, mammograms, bone density scans, stress tests, cholesterol screenings, blood pressure screenings, physical exams, general check-ups and other preventive health screenings—can cause many conditions to go undetected. As we mark National Women's Health Week, let us make sure that all women and girls, particularly those with underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and mental health needs, can prioritize their own health.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has further revealed why the unique needs of women and girls must be centered in our health care system, and further brought to light the health disparities and systemic biases that women, particularly women of color, continue to face, including inequitable maternity care and access to reproductive health care.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration aims to address persistent and unconscionable disparities in maternal health outcomes. Pregnancy-related mortality for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women is two to three times higher than for white, Hispanic, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women. Ensuring that all women have equitable access to health care before, during, and after pregnancy is essential. I am committed to building a health care system that delivers equity and dignity to all women and girls. In addition, we must protect access to sexual and reproductive health care, including the broad range of family planning services.</FP>
    <FP>As we strive to improve the health of our Nation, we must prioritize the health and well-being of our women and girls. During National Women's Health Week, we reaffirm our commitment to this important work.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 9 through May 15, 2021, as National Women's Health Week.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Each year on the second Sunday in May, we take time to thank and celebrate mothers across America—those who give us life and believe in us, so we can believe in ourselves. Throughout our history, even as they have nurtured and guided us, mothers have built, shaped, led, and sustained our Nation with selflessness and courage.</FP>
    <FP>Like so many fellow Americans observing this day without their Moms with them, I will spend this Mother's Day missing my own mom, Catherine Eugenia “Jean” Finnegan Biden. She taught me about the importance of family, loyalty, and faith. Even now, I hear her voice reminding me that everyone is equal and that we are all defined by our sense of honor, duty, and courage. Her immeasurable strength lives on in all of her children, her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren, and the many other lives that she touched.</FP>
    <FP>I will also spend this Mother's Day honoring the love of my life and the life of my love, Jill. In the many years of our marriage, she has healed our family, guided us through unimaginable hardships, and brought us untold joy and laughter. Her strength and determination have been our bedrock, and her warmth holds us all together.</FP>
    <FP>Through their unconditional love, mothers shape our lives and help us become the people we hope to be. We especially thank the mothers who have led us through the COVID-19 pandemic. From the earliest days of this crisis, so many mothers across our country have worked essential jobs, borne the brunt of our caregiving crisis, and selflessly provided support and comfort in a time of anxiety and fear. For many families, mothers took on the full-time role of teacher and caregiver when our schools and child care facilities were closed or operating remotely. In fact, this year, millions of moms left the workforce or deferred their education in order to provide care. New mothers faced pregnancy and childbirth without family and friends to support them—exacerbating a preexisting maternal health crisis which disproportionately impacts Black and Native American families. On Mother's Day, we also honor those who have suffered the profound loss of the life of a child and those grappling with uncertainty in hopes of becoming mothers someday.</FP>
    <FP>
        We also recognize that this will be the first Mother's Day for many families who lost their Mom due to COVID-19 and other diseases and cruel twists of fate of this past year. May God bless their memory and may this day fall gently on their loved ones left behind.
        <PRTPAGE P="122"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>When we support mothers, we support the prosperity, security, and well-being of our entire Nation. That's why my Administration is committed to fighting for safe and equitable workplaces, addressing barriers women face at work, closing the gender wage and wealth gaps, and making quality child care affordable so parents can work, knowing their children are in good hands.</FP>
    <FP>We've already begun this work through the American Rescue Plan's historic reductions in child poverty, ground-breaking investments in child care, and expanded support for families with children. Today, we are working to pass once-in-a-generation investments in our Nation's future through the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        Every day, we ask a great deal of the men and women of our Nation's law enforcement agencies; from ensuring public safety, to serving as front-line workers, to responding to incidents involving domestic violence, substance use disorders, mental health challenges, and homelessness, often with limited resources. Every morning, our Nation's law enforcement officers pin on a badge and go to work, not knowing what the day will bring, and hoping to come home safely. This year, even as the COVID-19 pandemic took a 
        <PRTPAGE P="123"/>
        physical, mental, and emotional toll, our officers, deputies, and troopers demonstrated courage and dedication in continuing to support our communities. As we recognize Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty, and thank them on behalf of this grateful Nation for their service.
    </FP>
    <FP>The economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has strained State, local, and Tribal budgets—forcing many communities to stretch their funding, consider layoffs, and reduce public services. My Administration will support our Nation's law enforcement agencies and officers and work to ensure they have the resources and research tools they need to do their jobs successfully and the funding necessary to enhance officer safety and wellness, including improving access to mental health services. We will also continue to bolster initiatives that protect our law enforcement officers' physical safety—including those that provide for bulletproof vests and active shooter training.</FP>
    <FP>This year, we also recognize that in many of our communities, especially Black and brown communities, there is a deep sense of distrust towards law enforcement; a distrust that has been exacerbated by the recent deaths of several Black and brown people at the hands of law enforcement. These deaths have resulted in a profound fear, trauma, pain, and exhaustion for many Black and brown Americans, and the resulting breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the communities they have sworn to protect and serve ultimately makes officers' jobs harder and more dangerous as well. In order to rebuild that trust, our State, local, and Federal Government and law enforcement agencies must protect constitutional rights, ensure accountability for misconduct, and embrace policing that reflects community values and ensures community safety. These approaches benefit those who wear the badge and those who count on their protection.</FP>
    <FP>We must also stop tasking law enforcement with problems that are far beyond their jurisdictions. From providing emergency health care to resolving school discipline issues, our communities rely on the police to perform services that often should be the duty of other institutions. We then accuse the police of failure when responsibility lies with public policy choices they did not make. Supporting our law enforcement officers requires that we invest in underfunded public systems that provide health care, counseling, housing, education, and other social services.</FP>
    <FP>There are many ways we can demonstrate appreciation for our law enforcement heroes. We recognize acts of bravery through the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor and the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery. We must also acknowledge the challenge and value of their service through the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017 and the Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019. Should tragedy strike, Public Safety Officers' benefits must be available for the families of officers who lose their lives or are catastrophically injured in the line of duty.</FP>
    <FP>
        This country asks much of our Federal, State, Tribal, and local police officers and deputies, and it is our solemn responsibility to ensure that those who protect and serve have the training, resources, and support they need to do their jobs well. My Administration will do everything we can to support the men and women who so courageously protect us.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On Armed Forces Day, we honor and offer our profound appreciation and gratitude to the patriots who are serving in our Nation's Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and Coast Guard. Their professionalism and unwavering dedication to supporting and defending our Constitution has been vital in allowing our democracy to flourish, safeguarding peace and growing prosperity for our citizens, and giving hope to oppressed peoples or those facing tyranny abroad. Less than one percent of Americans serve on active duty in the Armed Forces. Those who do volunteer to put their lives on the line to protect our country and democracy wherever they are called to serve. Whether they are Active Duty, National Guard, or in the Reserve, they are true American heroes, and we all owe them.</FP>
    <FP>Our military members do not swear allegiance to an individual, group, or political party. Their oath is to the United States Constitution. By bringing together people from different races, religions, and sexual orientations and melding them into a cohesive fighting force, our military embodies the promise of our democratic experiment. My Administration is determined to foster an environment that empowers our Armed Forces and improves retention and promotion of the best talent, to strengthen military readiness. Any ideology, actions, or influences that seek to undermine this solidarity must be exposed and eliminated.</FP>
    <FP>
        The unmatched strength of the United States Armed Forces reflects our greatest strength as a people, our diversity. Our military has proven—time 
        <PRTPAGE P="126"/>
        and time again—that the insistent pursuit of greater inclusion and equality makes us a more robust, more resilient, and more powerful Nation. As we pay tribute to those who serve, we acknowledge our continuing obligation to ensure that all qualified and willing Americans who wish to serve in the United States Armed Forces are able to do so openly and free from discrimination.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to confronting and driving out sexual assault and harassment, so that all members of the Armed Services feel safe and welcome in the ranks. We will improve retention and promotion of our best talent by using a single standard, one based on excellence.</FP>
    <FP>The Biden family knows personally that the burden of service does not fall solely on those who wear a uniform. Our military family members also serve our country and make great sacrifices to support their loved ones. They give their best to their service members, and we must give our best to ensuring military families have what they need to thrive. This is a national security imperative that supports military retention and readiness, and my Administration is committed to supporting policies that promote the well-being of our war fighters and their families.</FP>
    <FP>Through the First Lady's work with Joining Forces, the White House has committed to supporting military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors through economic and entrepreneurship opportunities, support for military child education, and health and well-being resources. Joining Forces will continue to convene and collaborate with Federal agency partners, non-profit organizations, corporate stakeholders, and service providers to develop comprehensive, meaningful, and long-term solutions to address the holistic well-being of military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.</FP>
    <FP>The United States Armed Forces are the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. They defend universal values and advance the cause of freedom around the globe. On this day, we salute and show gratitude for all who serve and commit to ensuring our Armed Forces remain strong, united, and unmatched.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</FP>
    <FP>I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Emergency Medical Services Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every day, in communities across the country, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers put themselves on the line to save lives, safeguard dangerous situations, and deliver hope to families and communities in crisis. With selflessness, professionalism, and grace under fire, they provide essential care—never more so than during our battle with COVID-19 over the past year. This year's Emergency Medical Services Week theme, “THIS IS EMS: Caring for Our Communities,” honors our heroic frontline workers who provide vital emergency medical care and ease the burden of crisis for Americans in need of help.</FP>
    <FP>Through service, compassion, and dedication, EMS providers represent the very best of the American spirit. In the face of unprecedented challenges, their expertise, endurance, and hard work have been a literal lifeline for families in every community. Whether responding to the enormous suffering caused by COVID-19, the devastation of extreme climate events, or daily medical emergencies, EMS providers—many of whom are volunteers—prepare, sacrifice, and put others ahead of themselves. Not only do they assume the heightened risks associated with emergency care during a pandemic, but they also spend countless hours away from families and friends in order to serve their communities.</FP>
    <FP>In the face of these challenges, EMS providers have not hesitated to take on new roles, including supporting COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccination sites. To help support the women and men who do this vital work, my American Rescue Plan included $100 million to support the mental well-being—including the mental health—of our health care professionals, paraprofessionals, public safety officers, and EMS providers. My Administration has also made it a priority to ensure that our State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners have the resources they need so that EMS providers are trained and equipped to respond to public health emergencies safely and effectively, now and in the future.</FP>
    <FP>
        During Emergency Medical Services Week, we extend our deepest gratitude to all EMS providers. Their courage, selflessness, and commitment are extraordinary examples of what it means to serve this great country. We also extend our sincere condolences to the loved ones of EMS providers who have given their lives in the line of duty. This week and every week, I urge 
        <PRTPAGE P="128"/>
        all Americans to express their appreciation for our Nation's EMS providers—and to bring greater safety to their lives, and to all of our lives, by getting vaccinated to help bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since our Nation's founding, our transportation infrastructure has enabled our economic growth and enhanced our national security. From the American merchant ships that carried supplies to support military operations during the Revolutionary War, to the Erie Canal opening the Midwest and West for growth, to the transcontinental railroad linking our Nation after the Civil War; to the interstate highway system transforming the way we travel, live, and work, our transportation infrastructure has supported national defense and powered interstate commerce. On National Defense Transportation Day and during National Transportation Week, we take time to recognize the transformational role infrastructure has played throughout our history, and reflect on the work and investment required to build an even stronger, more sustainable, and more equitable transportation system of the future.</FP>
    <FP>America's transportation system has always proven vital for civilian and military organizations, something we have seen demonstrated in our Nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dedicated workers, using a comprehensive transportation plan, including airports, highways, railroads, waterways, and public transit, enabled the Federal Government to distribute tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccines and helped us deliver over 200 million shots in my first 100 days as President.</FP>
    <FP>
        Even as we recognize the essential nature of our transportation system, we must recognize that the system was built in a way that harmed vulnerable communities, does not provide equal services to all people, creates harmful local pollution, and contributes to climate change. We also must address the fact that decades of disinvestment and neglect have caused our roads, bridges and water systems to fall into disrepair.
        <PRTPAGE P="129"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>A disproportionate number of infrastructure needs occur in underserved or underrepresented communities where people depend upon transportation systems for work and daily activities. The lack of affordable transportation options means lack of access to good-paying jobs, education, and health care. Modern and resilient infrastructure supporting reliable and affordable transportation options make the American Dream possible for all of us, regardless of geography, race, disability, or economic status.</FP>
    <FP>For all of these reasons, I have proposed an American Jobs Plan that will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets, fix the Nation's 10 most economically significant bridges in America in need of replacement, and repair 10,000 bridges desperately in need of upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe, and connect our cities, towns, and Tribes across the country. It will build back a better transportation system—one that is resilient to floods, fires, and storms, and provides equitable, affordable access to opportunity for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>The American Jobs Plan will replace buses and rail cars, build new rail corridors and transit lines—easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to city centers. It will reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and airports. The plan will also create good-quality jobs paying prevailing wages in safe and healthy workplaces while ensuring workers have a free and fair choice to organize, join a union, and bargain collectively with their employers.</FP>
    <FP>As our Nation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic destruction it caused, we have a chance to build back better by focusing on infrastructure that reconnects communities, provides equitable access to transportation services, and mitigates the devastating effects of climate change.</FP>
    <FP>This month we recognize the dedicated men and women who kept this Nation moving during the depths of a global pandemic: The truckers who delivered groceries to empty store shelves; the airline crews who flew medical workers to COVID-19 hotspots; the United States military members who remained on the front lines to distribute and administer vaccines in record time; and the transportation workers who kept our systems running as economies shut down. We thank you for serving the American people and the traveling public.</FP>
    <FP>In recognition of the ongoing contributions of our Nation's transportation system and in honor of the devoted professionals who work to sustain its tradition of excellence, the United States Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third Friday in May of each year as “National Defense Transportation Day” and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week in which that Friday falls be designated as “National Transportation Week.”</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 21, 2021, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 16 through May 22, 2021, as National Transportation Week.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it not only inflicted an enormous toll on American lives and livelihoods—it brought unprecedented disruption to the global economy as well. That disruption represents a major threat to workers and employers in every community who rely on trade to grow jobs here at home, from small businesses that sell their goods to customers overseas, to major United States industries that depend on imported components in the products they make in America. As we work to defeat the pandemic and build back better, World Trade Week reminds us of the important role that global trade plays in creating jobs and strengthening the United States economy—and of our responsibility to pursue trade policies that center on American workers.</FP>
    <FP>The United States can out-compete any country in the world. We have all the skills and strengths that we need to win the competition for the future, including a fiercely innovative and productive workforce. And if we make the smart investments to hone our competitive edge, no nation will be able to match us. That is why my Administration is not only focused on creating millions of good-paying jobs here at home, and supporting America's working families, we are committed to making the single biggest investment in American innovation and competitiveness since World War II. Through the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan, we will be taking on four major challenges to fortify our foundation: strengthening our industrial and innovation base to ensure that the future is made in America; investing in sustainable infrastructure and laying the foundation for a clean energy future; investing in our caring economy to ease the burden of care on working families; and advancing racial equity across the board to ensure that Americans in every community see the benefits of a revitalized economy and United States leadership on the world economic stage.</FP>
    <FP>To support those efforts, we are committed to strengthening existing trade policies—and developing new ones aimed toward promoting equitable growth, protecting workers' rights, and advancing environmental justice. We are also holding our trade partners accountable and ensuring that they do not gain competitive advantages by violating workers' rights or engaging in unfair trade practices.</FP>
    <FP>
        Enforcing our Nation's trade rules and ensuring a level playing field is critical to making trade work for American workers and businesses. The United States is working bilaterally and multilaterally with our partners to develop standards that support workers, reduce export barriers, and hold 
        <PRTPAGE P="131"/>
        accountable those who abuse and exploit the global trading system. We are working with international organizations to implement reforms and address current challenges, including economic, racial, and social inequities, as well as the climate crisis.
    </FP>
    <FP>If we invest in America, and if we make sure that the United States and our partners write the rules of the road when it comes to global trade, then American factory workers, retail workers, farmers, ranchers, and fishers in every community will have a better chance to earn their place in the middle class and live lives of greater opportunity. We will be more competitive around the world—and stronger, more prosperous, and more resilient here at home.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 2021, as World Trade Week.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hepatitis Testing Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year have reinforced many public health lessons, including the importance of communication, community engagement, and a comprehensive testing strategy to reduce the spread of infection. These same lessons hold true for another epidemic affecting our Nation: the silent epidemic of viral hepatitis. Viral hepatitis is a serious, preventable public health threat that puts people who are infected at increased risk for serious disease and death. When left undiagnosed and untreated, hepatitis B and hepatitis C can cause liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even early death. Hepatitis D, which occurs only among individuals infected with hepatitis B, can also cause serious liver disease. On this National Hepatitis Testing Day, I call on all Americans who are at risk for hepatitis to get tested, and for all health care providers to educate their patients about viral hepatitis.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation has set a goal to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Thanks to Federal investment in medical research, we have the technology and tools to provide safe and effective hepatitis vaccines and therapeutics that can reduce mortality and even lead to a cure. Despite this progress, an estimated 2.4 million Americans are living with hepatitis C, and more than 860,000 are living with hepatitis B—many of whom unknowingly suffer its effects. Approximately 200,000 Americans are infected with hepatitis D every year. Infection with hepatitis D in an individual already infected 
        <PRTPAGE P="132"/>
        with hepatitis B—known as superinfection—leads to a more rapid progression towards liver cancer. We must increase prevention, testing, and awareness to provide people the life-saving treatment they need. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing with no cost-sharing.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening and testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D based on risk, health status, and pregnancy. It is important we implement these recommendations to ensure proper treatment and help stop the spread of hepatitis. For more information on the recommendations, visit cdc.gov/hepatitis.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to addressing the health disparities and health inequities, which, as with so many health metrics, are also seen with viral hepatitis. Viral hepatitis disproportionately impacts Black and brown Americans, Indigenous persons, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The interplay of factors such as poverty, inadequate housing and transportation, food insecurity, access to care, access to addiction treatment and mental health care, medical mistrust, language and cultural barriers, stigma, and discrimination must be addressed if we are to eliminate these health disparities and advance health equity. The recently released Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan: A Roadmap to Elimination is focused on making sure more people living with viral hepatitis are tested and aware of their status and providing a roadmap for quality care and treatment. To read more about the plan, visit hhs.gov/hepatitis.</FP>
    <FP>The viral hepatitis epidemic is also linked with other public health threats, including HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and opioid use. Our response to the public health challenges of viral hepatitis, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and substance use disorders will require a focus on the people and places where these risk factors intersect, and doing more to test people for viral hepatitis and other infections. We also need to scale-up vaccinations, testing, and care in settings where people at risk receive other services. Implementing point-of-care testing in outreach settings, utilizing clinical decision support tools, and increasing provider awareness and training for implementing testing recommendations will help improve diagnoses and awareness. The ability to reduce viral hepatitis infections will depend on integrated strategies and a comprehensive approach to address our ongoing challenges.</FP>
    <FP>Viral hepatitis exacts a significant toll on our Nation's health, and the stigma and discrimination associated with the disease further impair the quality of life among those affected. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring everyone knows their viral hepatitis status, has access to high quality care and treatment, and lives free from stigma and discrimination.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19, 2021, as National Hepatitis Testing Day. I encourage all Americans to join in activities that will increase awareness about viral hepatitis and increase viral hepatitis testing.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Safe Boating Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every year, millions of Americans take time to enjoy our Nation's waterways—one of our great natural treasures. As more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19, and as warmer weather draws families to our Nation's lakes, rivers, and beaches, this week serves as a critical reminder of the importance of staying safe on the water. Each year during National Safe Boating Week, the Coast Guard and an array of Federal, State, and local partners help save lives and guard against accidents by highlighting safe boating practices.</FP>
    <FP>This year, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971. The Act created a partnership between the Federal Government and the States to improve the safety of recreational boating. It also established the National Recreational Boating Safety Program and gave the Coast Guard the authority to establish mandatory boat manufacturing and safety standards. The Coast Guard estimates that these efforts have saved nearly 100,000 lives over the last half century.</FP>
    <FP>While most boating trips are enjoyable and safe, tragedy still strikes with alarming frequency. Since 2000, there have been over 13,000 boating-related deaths and over 64,000 boating-related injuries, many of which could have been prevented if proper safety precautions were taken. Whether you are fishing, sailing, or out on the water with family or friends, it is essential to follow safe boating practices for your own protection and the protection of those around you.</FP>
    <FP>Safe boating begins with education and planning. Human error contributes to the vast majority of boating accidents, which can be minimized by taking an “on-water” boating safety course. Learning and improving your boating skills help increase the odds of an enjoyable and safe boating experience. Every American can ensure that their boat is ready for the water by obtaining a free vessel safety check offered through the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.</FP>
    <FP>
        I call upon all Americans to follow safe boating practices. By following basic boating safety procedures—wearing life jackets, carrying lifesaving emergency distress and communications equipment, judiciously using the engine cut-off switch, and staying sober when boating—we can prevent the vast majority of boating fatalities and help ensure boaters on America's coastal, inland, and offshore waters stay safe throughout the season.
        <PRTPAGE P="134"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as “National Safe Boating Week.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22 through May 28, 2021, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning and practicing safe boating behaviors. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety through events and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Maritime Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since the first days of our Republic, America has been a proud maritime Nation. To this day, the United States Merchant Marine is a pillar of our country's prosperity, playing a vital role in the maintenance of our economic and national security. Through every period of peace and war, our merchant mariners have been dedicated to protecting our freedom and promoting commerce. On National Maritime Day, we honor the steadfast commitment and sacrifices of the men and women who serve in the United States Merchant Marine, and recognize their essential role in safeguarding and strengthening our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Called the “fourth arm of defense” by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, the Merchant Marine established itself as a cornerstone of sealift support for our Armed Forces, sailing through theaters of war to deliver troops and supplies while keeping vital ocean supply lines operating. The perseverance and dedication of the Merchant Marine contributed to the Allied victory even as they suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any of our military services.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our merchant mariners also play a critical role in times of peace. They ensure our economic security by keeping our coastal and inland waterways open to trade, while United States-flagged ships operated by American merchant mariners transport goods across our country and all over the world. United States maritime freight operations helped support $5.4 trillion of economic activity among the many non-maritime industries that depend on the Merchant Marine for access to world markets. This movement of goods domestically and internationally continues to ensure America's economic competitiveness throughout the world—growing jobs and supporting businesses of all sizes here at home.
        <PRTPAGE P="135"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Our merchant mariners are also critical to extending United States support and assistance to foreign nations and local communities hit hard by natural disasters and devastating crises. Even in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, these brave men and women have overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to fulfill their mission while keeping our Nation's supply chains running.</FP>
    <FP>The operation of the United States-flagged fleet is essential in contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and landside congestion, helping provide current and future generations with a more sustainable means of freight transportation. The industry is also working to develop and implement new technologies to continue reducing emissions—an effort my Administration is supporting through new international partnerships.</FP>
    <FP>The maritime industry has long provided opportunity for Americans of all backgrounds—and the Merchant Marine continues to advance a more equitable industry in which barriers to entry and advancement are eliminated.</FP>
    <FP>On this National Maritime Day, we honor the brave merchant mariners who provide critical support to our troops stationed in warzones, and who are essential to our Nation's economic success. Recognizing the contributions of our merchant mariners, my Administration strongly supports protecting the Jones Act—the cornerstone of our domestic maritime industry. We must protect those who protect our country.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as “National Maritime Day” to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah. By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2021, as National Maritime Day.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On Memorial Day, we honor and reflect upon the courage, integrity, and selfless dedication of the members of our Armed Forces who have made the greatest sacrifice in service to our Nation. Whether in the waters of the Pacific, on the beachheads of Europe, in the deserts of the Middle East, or in the mountains of Afghanistan, American service members have given their lives to uphold our Constitution and to defend the safety and freedoms of our citizens. These patriots embody the best of the American spirit. They put themselves on the line for our shared values—for duty, honor, country—and they paid the ultimate price. Our Nation can never fully repay the debt we owe to our fallen heroes and their families.</FP>
    <FP>Jill and I know what it means to have a child serving in a war zone—the ever-present concern for your loved one and their fellow service members. Today and every day, we ask God to protect our troops. We also recognize the tremendous loss endured by America's Gold Star families—the families of military members who died in conflict. We have a sacred obligation as a Nation to support those families and to always honor the memories of their loved ones.</FP>
    <FP>
        That is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day. Our Nation will never forget the courage and patriotism demonstrated by the countless women and men who laid down their lives so that we may continue to pursue a more perfect Union and to protect the unalienable rights Americans hold dear. They came from every part of the country, of every background and belief, united by a shared belief in our uniquely American creed—that all people are created equal. We will honor their legacy by continuing our work to live up to that commitment and to advance the values they lived and died to defend. We will continue to fight for equity and inclusion in our country and institutions, and ensure every qualified American who is willing to serve our country—regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or background—has a fair and equal opportunity to do so.
        <PRTPAGE P="137"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>We will continue to honor our fallen service members through the actions of a new generation who volunteer to serve in uniform, who anchor our military to our democratic values, and who stand ready to deter aggression from our enemies and, if required, fight and defend our Nation. Today—as we keep true to the memory of our fallen heroes—we will endeavor to meet their legacy and once more lead the world through the power of our example and not just the example of our power.</FP>
    <FP>As our Nation's service members continue to risk their lives to protect our homeland and thwart our enemies, we must not lose sight of our desire for enduring peace. Every day, countless Americans pray and work for peace so that we may one day live in a world where American patriots need not make the ultimate sacrifice, and where all people live in freedom and prosperity. As a Nation, we are grateful to the brave members of our Armed Services—both past and present—who have forged the legacy for that possibility.</FP>
    <FP>In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 2021, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer and reflection. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance. I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.</FP>
    <FP>I request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Day of Remembrance: 100 Years After the 1921 Tulsa Race MassacreBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>One hundred years ago, a violent white supremacist mob raided, firebombed, and destroyed approximately 35 square blocks of the thriving Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Families and children were murdered in cold blood. Homes, businesses, and churches were burned. In all, as many as 300 Black Americans were killed, and nearly 10,000 were left destitute and homeless. Today, on this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our Nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country.</FP>
    <FP>Before the Tulsa Race Massacre, Greenwood was a thriving Black community that had grown into a proud economic and cultural hub. At its center was Greenwood Avenue, commonly known as Black Wall Street. Many of Greenwood's 10,000 residents were Black sharecroppers who fled racial violence after the Civil War.</FP>
    <FP>In the decades following the Civil War and Reconstruction, Greenwood became a place where Black Americans were able to make a new start and secure economic progress despite the continued pain of institutional and overt racism. The community was home to a growing number of prominent Black entrepreneurs as well as working-class Black families who shared a commitment to social activism and economic opportunity. As Greenwood grew, Greenwood Avenue teemed with successful Black-owned businesses, including restaurants, grocery stores, hotels, and offices for doctors, lawyers, and dentists. The community also maintained its own school system, post office, a savings and loan institution, hospital, and bus and taxi service.</FP>
    <FP>Despite rising Jim Crow systems and the reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan, Greenwood's economic prosperity grew, as did its citizens' demands for equal rights. This made the community a source of pride for many Black Americans. It also made the neighborhood and its families a target of white supremacists. In 2 days, a violent mob tore down the hard-fought success of Black Wall Street that had taken more than a decade to build.</FP>
    <FP>In the years that followed, the destruction caused by the mob was followed by laws and policies that made recovery nearly impossible. In the aftermath of the attack, local ordinances were passed requiring new construction standards that were prohibitively expensive, meaning many Black families could not rebuild. Later, Greenwood was redlined by mortgage companies and deemed “hazardous” by the Federal Government so that Black homeowners could not access home loans or credit on equal terms. And in later decades, Federal investment, including Federal highway construction, tore down and cut off parts of the community. The attack on Black families and Black wealth in Greenwood persisted across generations.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Federal Government must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities. 
        <PRTPAGE P="139"/>
        The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to acknowledging the role Federal policy played in Greenwood and other Black communities and addressing longstanding racial inequities through historic investments in the economic security of children and families, programs to provide capital for small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas, including minority-owned businesses, and ensuring that infrastructure projects increase opportunity, advance racial equity and environmental justice, and promote affordable access.
    </FP>
    <FP>A century later, the fear and pain from the devastation of Greenwood is still felt. As Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old survivor of the Tulsa Race Massacre courageously testified before the Congress recently, “I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home. I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history, but I cannot.”</FP>
    <FP>With this proclamation, I commit to the survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, including Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis, and Lessie Benningfield Randle, the descendants of victims, and to this Nation that we will never forget. We honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 31, 2021, a Day of Remembrance: 100 Years After The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. I call upon the people of the United States to commemorate the tremendous loss of life and security that occurred over those 2 days in 1921, to celebrate the bravery and resilience of those who survived and sought to rebuild their lives again, and commit together to eradicate systemic racism and help to rebuild communities and lives that have been destroyed by it.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        Throughout our history, there has been no richer influence on the American songbook than Black music and culture. From early spirituals born out of the unconscionable hardships of slavery; to the creation of folk and gospel; to the evolution of rhythm and blues and jazz; to the ascendance of rock and roll, rap, and hip-hop—Black music has shaped our society, entertained and inspired us, and helped write and tell the story of our Nation.
        <PRTPAGE P="140"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>During Black Music Appreciation Month, we honor the innovative artists whose musical expressions move us, brighten our daily lives, and bring us together. Across the generations, Black music has pioneered the way we listen to music while preserving Black cultural traditions and sharing the unique experiences of the Black community. Black artists have dramatically influenced what we all hear and feel through music—joy and sadness, love and loss, pride and purpose.</FP>
    <FP>Black music has always stood on its own—a beacon of resilience and resistance—while at the same time helping to shape countless other musical and cultural traditions. From the syncopated rhythms of jazz to the soulful expressions of R&amp;B, Black music spans an extraordinarily broad spectrum of genres and styles. The distinct voices and instruments of Black artists have filled the halls of the Apollo Theater in New York City, Preservation Hall in New Orleans, the Fillmore in San Francisco, and other iconic venues throughout the United States and around the world, energizing audiences and inspiring millions. The music created and expressed by Black communities has paved the way for generations of musicians across all races, creeds, colors, religions, sexual orientations, and identities. The creativity and spirit of Black music is everywhere, and our Nation and the world are richer for it.</FP>
    <FP>This month, we also honor the many important contributors to our Nation's musical heritage that are no longer with us. And although they have taken their final bows, their musical legacies and influence will live on in our hearts and souls, and inspire a new generation of artists and fans.</FP>
    <FP>In appreciating the indelible contributions of Black Americans to the music landscape, we must also recognize the crisis of racial inequity that Black Americans have faced in America for centuries—a crisis that is often reflected and challenged in Black music. We must rededicate ourselves to rooting out systemic racism from every part of our society, and work together to advance racial justice and equity. In the music industry, that work includes identifying and eliminating barriers that Black creatives face in producing and maintaining ownership of their music and other creations. In this month of June, we celebrate the Black music that has shaped and enlivened our lives and our country, and recommit ourselves to advancing racial equity for artists—and for everyone.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as Black Music Appreciation Month.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America's great outdoors, diverse landscapes, and pristine waterways are a limitless source of pride, inspiration, and sustenance of both body and soul—and an essential part of our national identity. It is our shared responsibility as Americans to be good stewards of these irreplaceable treasures for our children and grandchildren, and for generations to come. During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate our Nation's natural wonders, and rededicate ourselves to conserving nature's splendor for all Americans and safeguarding our environment against the existential threat of climate change and other challenges.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation is blessed by an abundance of incredible outdoor spaces that provide opportunities for exploration, recreation, and rejuvenation. From the Sierra Nevadas to the Ozark Trail to the Everglades—to local trails and parks in every part of the country—the outdoors inspire creativity, provide educational opportunities, and bring communities together. This past year, so many of us have developed an even greater appreciation for the powerful role that outdoor spaces play in our physical and mental well-being—providing outlets for activity, solace, and connection in the midst of a devastating pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>Now more than ever, we must rise to meet the challenges of environmental degradation, climate change, and inequitable access to nature. The natural world provides critical resources that sustain all life on Earth—from the air we breathe and the water we drink to the food we eat. Ensuring that we maintain healthy ecosystems and a resilient planet is not just a matter of environmentalism. It is also critical to our health, our safety, the security of our families, and the strength of our economy.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to taking swift action to address the existential threat of climate change. I have proposed a major investment to put Americans to work building critical industries to produce and deploy clean technologies—reducing harmful emissions, and putting us on the path to a more sustainable and equitable future while creating millions of good-paying jobs. We are going to put Americans to work building a clean, resilient power grid; capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells and coal mines to put a stop to methane leaks; constructing the next generation of electric vehicles; and developing new carbon capture and green hydrogen technologies on farms and in factories to make everything from our steel and cement to our agricultural sector cleaner and more sustainable. We will also speed up implementation of the Great American Outdoors Act, which invests in conservation projects that will benefit communities across the country—including Black and brown communities that have too often been excluded from our great outdoor spaces. My Administration has also outlined a new “America the Beautiful” initiative to bring the Federal Government together with State, Tribal, and local partners to conserve at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.</FP>
    <FP>
        During Great Outdoors Month, I encourage all Americans to explore our Nation's beautiful outdoor spaces. As we enjoy the great outdoors—from 
        <PRTPAGE P="142"/>
        national parks to our own backyards—let us rededicate ourselves to conserving our Nation's natural spaces for our own well-being, and for the health, safety, prosperity, and fulfillment of generations to come.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The uprising at the Stonewall Inn in June, 1969, sparked a liberation movement—a call to action that continues to inspire us to live up to our Nation's promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. Pride is a time to recall the trials the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) community has endured and to rejoice in the triumphs of trailblazing individuals who have bravely fought—and continue to fight—for full equality. Pride is both a jubilant communal celebration of visibility and a personal celebration of self-worth and dignity. This Pride Month, we recognize the valuable contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals across America, and we reaffirm our commitment to standing in solidarity with LGBTQ+ Americans in their ongoing struggle against discrimination and injustice.</FP>
    <FP>The LGBTQ+ community in America has achieved remarkable progress since Stonewall. Historic Supreme Court rulings in recent years have struck down regressive laws, affirmed the right to marriage equality, and secured workplace protections for LGBTQ+ individuals in every State and Territory. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act broadened the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity. Members of the LGBTQ+ community now serve in nearly every level of public office—in city halls and State capitals, Governors' mansions and the halls of the Congress, and throughout my Administration. Nearly 14 percent of my 1,500 agency appointees identify as LGBTQ+, and I am particularly honored by the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person to be confirmed by the Senate.</FP>
    <FP>
        For all of our progress, there are many States in which LGBTQ+ individuals still lack protections for fundamental rights and dignity in hospitals, 
        <PRTPAGE P="143"/>
        schools, public accommodations, and other spaces. Our Nation continues to witness a tragic spike in violence against transgender women of color. LGBTQ+ individuals—especially youth who defy sex or gender norms—face bullying and harassment in educational settings and are at a disproportionate risk of self-harm and death by suicide. Some States have chosen to actively target transgender youth through discriminatory bills that defy our Nation's values of inclusivity and freedom for all.
    </FP>
    <FP>Our Nation also continues to face tragic levels of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color. And we are still haunted by tragedies such as the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. Ending violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community demands our continued focus and diligence. As President, I am committed to defending the rights of all LGBTQ+ individuals.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is taking historic actions to finally deliver full equality for LGBTQ+ families. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order charging Federal agencies to fully enforce all Federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. As a result, the Federal Government has taken steps to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in employment, health care, housing, lending, and education. I also signed an Executive Order affirming all qualified Americans will be able to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States—including patriotic transgender Americans who can once again proudly and openly serve their Nation in uniform—and a National Security Memorandum that commits to supporting LGBTQ+ Federal employees serving overseas. My Administration is also working to promote and protect LGBTQ+ human rights abroad. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights, which is why my Administration has reaffirmed America's commitment to supporting those on the front lines of the equality and democracy movements around the world, often at great risk. We see you, we support you, and we are inspired by your courage to accept nothing less than full equality.</FP>
    <FP>While I am proud of the progress my Administration has made in advancing protections for the LGBTQ+ community, I will not rest until full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans is finally achieved and codified into law. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act, which will ensure civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ people and families across our country. And that is why we must recognize emerging challenges, like the fact that many LGBTQ+ seniors, who faced discrimination and oppression throughout their lives, are isolated and need support and elder care.</FP>
    <FP>During LGBTQ+ Pride Month, we recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically. In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds, and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America. This Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people, and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the achievements of the LGBTQ+ community, to celebrate the great diversity of the American people, and to wave their flags of pride high.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America's diversity is and always has been the defining strength of our Nation—in every generation, our society, spirit, and shared ambitions have been refreshed by wave after wave of immigrants seeking out their American dream. Throughout our history, Caribbean Americans have brought vibrant cultures, languages, traditions, and values that strengthen our country and add new chapters to our common story. In recognition of Caribbean Americans' countless gifts and contributions to our Nation, we celebrate National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.</FP>
    <FP>Caribbean Americans have made our country more innovative and more prosperous; they have enriched our Nation's arts and culture, our public institutions, and our economy. I am honored to celebrate this National Caribbean-American Heritage Month alongside Caribbean-American barrier-breaking public servants in my Administration—including Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice—all of whom continue to be sources of pride and inspiration for Caribbean Americans across the country.</FP>
    <FP>
        Caribbean-American intellects and artists like James Weldon Johnson, the poet who gave us the anthem, 
        <E T="03">Lift Every Voice and Sing</E>
        ; celebrated neo-expressionist painter Jean-Michel Basquiat; and John B. Russwurm, the first Caribbean-American editor of a U.S. newspaper, have left a lasting impact on our country. Caribbean-American jurists like Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman appointed to the Federal bench, and the Nation's first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, have made innumerable contributions to the American justice system. Shirley Chisholm, the daughter of Caribbean immigrants, blazed new trails as our Nation's first Black Congresswoman—and the first Black woman to launch a major-party bid for the Presidency. Public servants like Antonia Novello, our Nation's first female Surgeon General, and Colin Powell, our first Black Secretary of State, have followed in her footsteps, charting new paths of their own in service to the American people.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Despite the powerful legacy of achievement of Caribbean Americans, many members of the Caribbean-American community continue to face systemic barriers to equity, opportunity, and justice. Systemic racism has uniquely impacted Black and Latino immigrant communities, including Caribbean Americans, leading to disparities in health care, education, housing, criminal justice, and economic opportunity. My Administration is committed to addressing those entrenched disparities—and to bringing our Nation closer 
        <PRTPAGE P="145"/>
        to its promise that all people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. That is why I have launched a whole-of-government approach to advancing racial justice and equity.
    </FP>
    <FP>During National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the legacy and essential contributions of Caribbean Americans who have added so much to our American fabric.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to join in celebrating the history, culture, and achievements of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Homeownership Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For millions of Americans, homeownership is the cornerstone of a life with security, with dignity, and with hope. A home is more than four walls and a roof; it is a place where we can celebrate triumphs and weather the trials of life. A place where we can watch our families grow and prosper. A place that helps us build wealth we can pass down to our children and our grandchildren.</FP>
    <FP>The aspiration to own a home is connected deeply to the American dream. It has driven generations of Americans, in search of a place to call one's own.</FP>
    <FP>Today, for people across the United States, the desire to own a home burns as brightly as it ever has. Yet the stark reality is that, for too many, the dream of homeownership is becoming more difficult to realize and sustain. This is especially true in the wake of the economic devastation inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>We also know that people of color continue to face discrimination in our housing market—when trying to secure mortgages, to have their homes appraised, and to live in neighborhoods where their families can thrive. In recent years, the homeownership gap between Black and white families reached its widest point since 1968, when banks could still legally discriminate against borrowers based on the color of their skin.</FP>
    <FP>
        This is economically and morally wrong, and it is why, as President, I have made it a central priority to expand stability and opportunity within our housing market. On my first day in office, I took executive action to extend foreclosure moratoriums for nearly 11 million households with mortgages 
        <PRTPAGE P="146"/>
        guaranteed by the Federal Government. My Administration introduced and passed the American Rescue Plan, which will deliver nearly $10 billion in relief for homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments during the pandemic. And to create greater opportunities for homeownership moving forward, we have proposed the American Jobs Plan—which can spur the construction and rehabilitation of more than 500,000 homes for buyers of more modest means.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will continue to advance affordable and sustainable homeownership throughout our Nation. This will require that we help more hardworking Americans purchase their first homes, increase access to credit and mortgage insurance for borrowers of color, and fully enforce the 1968 Fair Housing Act—to root out systemic discrimination from our housing market and break down the unjust barriers that prevent too many Americans from buying a home.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of this Nation to recognize the enduring value of homeownership and to recommit ourselves to helping more Americans realize that dream.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Immigrant Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America is, always has been, and always will be a Nation of immigrants. It was the premise of our founding; it is reflected in our Constitution; it is etched upon the Statue of Liberty—that “from her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome.” During National Immigrant Heritage Month, we reaffirm and draw strength from that enduring identity and celebrate the history and achievements of immigrant communities across our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Across each generation throughout our history, wave after wave of immigrants have enriched our Nation and made us better, stronger, more innovative, and more prosperous. The American story includes the story of courageous families who ventured here—be it centuries ago, or just this year—from every part of the world to seek new possibilities and help to forge our Nation. In every era, immigrant innovators, workers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders have fortified and defended us, fed us and cared for us, advanced the limits of our thinking, and broken new ground.</FP>
    <FP>
        After an especially difficult period marked by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the all-too-frequent demonization of immigrants, it is vital that 
        <PRTPAGE P="147"/>
        our Nation reflect on the leadership, resilience, and courage shown by generations of immigrant communities, and recommit ourselves to our values as a welcoming Nation. We recognize all of the workers, many of whom are immigrants, who have contributed to the food security, health, and safety of all Americans during this challenging year—and every year. And we honor the sacrifices made by immigrants who serve on the front lines of the pandemic as health care providers, first responders, teachers, grocers, farm workers, and other essential workers. It was these same immigrant families and communities of color who were disproportionately struck by the virus. In honor of those we've lost, let us dedicate ourselves as a Nation to protecting one another and doing our part to put an end to this pandemic for good.
    </FP>
    <FP>The promise of our Nation is that every American has a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead, yet systemic racism and persistent barriers have denied this promise to far too many immigrants throughout our history and today. I have placed equity at the center of my Administration's agenda. From day one, I promised that my Administration would reflect the full diversity of our Nation—and today, nearly one-third of my Administration's 1,500 political appointees are naturalized U.S. citizens or children of immigrants.</FP>
    <FP>I have directed Federal agencies to rebuild trust in our immigration system that has been lost, to reach out to underserved communities unable to access the opportunities our Nation offers them, to offer again a welcoming humanitarian hand to the persecuted and oppressed, and to reduce barriers to achieving citizenship and equality.</FP>
    <FP>I am honored to serve alongside Vice President Harris, the first daughter of immigrants to hold the Office of the Vice President, and to work with so many dedicated public servants who are immigrants—and who carry with them every day the legacies of their families' sacrifice and resilience.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the progress our Nation has made since our founding, there is more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to all our people. Nearly 11 million people in this country are undocumented—and it is time that the Congress acts by passing the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, the immigration reform plan that I introduced on day one of my Presidency. My plan would provide a pathway to lawful permanent residency and citizenship for these undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers, individuals with Temporary Protected Status, farm workers, and other essential workers who contribute to our Nation every day.</FP>
    <FP>Vice President Harris and I affirm that immigrants historically have made and continue to make our Nation stronger. I urge my fellow Americans to join us this month in celebrating immigrant heritage, stories, and cultures.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as National Immigrant Heritage Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about the history of immigrant communities throughout the generations following our Nation's founding, and to observe this month with appropriate programming and activities.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Ocean Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The world's ocean basins are critical to the success of our Nation and, indeed, to life on Earth. The ocean powers our economy, provides food for billions of people, supplies 50 percent of the world's oxygen, offers recreational opportunities for us to enjoy, and regulates weather patterns and our global climate system. During National Ocean Month, we celebrate our stewardship of the ocean and coasts, and reaffirm our commitment to protecting and sustaining them for current and future generations.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is dedicated to improving our Nation's public health by supporting resilient ocean habitats, wildlife, and resources in which all Americans rely on. Through our “America the Beautiful” initiative, we are working with State, Tribal, and local partners to conserve at least 30 percent of United States lands and waters by 2030—so that our natural world can continue to supply the food, clean air, and clean water that every one of us depends on to survive. We are also committed to supporting safe, plentiful, and sustainable seafood harvesting for domestic consumption and export, and reducing public health risks such as harmful algal blooms that have proliferated as a result of climate change and the acidification of our waters.</FP>
    <FP>The ocean has always been essential to our economy, and that will remain true as we build back better and develop the clean industries and good jobs of the future. My plan to dramatically expand offshore wind energy over the next 10 years will provide good-paying union jobs and a sustainable source of clean energy. Investing in resilient, reliable coastal infrastructure—including modern ports and waterways—that can withstand the impacts of rising seas and powerful storms will keep our economy competitive in the global marketplace while making our families safer. Conserving and restoring coastal wetlands and habitats will also strengthen our efforts to tackle climate change, improve the resilience of coastal communities, and help restore nursery areas that are important to our fisheries. Investing in our fishing communities and supporting local seafood supply options will also be critical to helping us build a climate-resilient, sustainable ocean economy.</FP>
    <FP>
        Climate change is a global challenge that is integrally linked to the ocean. By protecting our ocean and coastal ecosystems and resources, we are also protecting the worldwide economies and people that depend on them. To address these challenges, we are building on our Nation's long legacy of ocean exploration and research to gain new insights into ocean ecosystems 
        <PRTPAGE P="149"/>
        and biodiversity and ways the ocean can sequester and store carbon. Marine life, changing ocean conditions, and plastic and other pollution pay no attention to national boundaries. That is why we must focus on a worldwide approach to conservation and sustainability. In collaboration with our international partners, my Administration will continue America's global leadership in ocean science, stewardship, and conservation. Our engagement in international efforts, such as the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, reflects the priorities and values of my Administration to ensure that ocean science delivers greater benefits for the American people, the people of the world, and international ocean ecosystems.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also committed to delivering climate justice, including ensuring equitable access to our ocean and coasts for all Americans—and working to ensure that Indigenous Americans, Black Americans, and other people of color are no longer forced to shoulder disproportionate climate and environmental burdens, as they historically have. My Administration will work hard to further break down the barriers many communities of color face by creating new opportunities to diversify ocean-related access and workforces. We will also equip educators with tools to teach our Nation's youth how to become a powerful generation of ocean stewards.</FP>
    <FP>It is imperative that we take proper action now to ensure that the ocean continues to thrive. During National Ocean Month, we recognize the central role of a healthy ocean in sustaining all of our lives, and pledge to find innovative ways to conserve, protect, and restore our ocean.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2021 as National Ocean Month.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the midst of a revolution, less than a year after declaring our independence, the Congress consecrated what would become an enduring emblem of American unity by adopting a national flag on June 14, 1777.</FP>
    <FP>
        In the 244 years since, the United States has grown and changed across the generations—and our flag has changed in turn. The blue field of stars has been enlarged as our Union has gained in size and strength. The 13 stripes, symbolizing the 13 original States, have held as constant as the bedrock 
        <PRTPAGE P="150"/>
        values upon which our Nation was first conceived—the very same values we still cherish, and still reach for, today.
    </FP>
    <FP>Since adoption of the Stars and Stripes, Americans—and people around the world—have continuously looked to our flag as a symbol of unity and liberty. Our flag has sailed around the globe, and journeyed to the Moon and, now, to Mars. It has flown on fields of battle, and marks the resting places of those who have given what President Lincoln called “the last full measure of devotion” for our country. Its prominence at civic landmarks and seats of public authority communicates the promise of democracy—that under this flag, the rule of law is supreme and the people reign. As we continue the sacred work of building a more perfect Union together, let our flag serve as a reminder to us, and to the world, that America stands for and strives for the promise of freedom, justice, and equality for all.</FP>
    <FP>To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as “Flag Day” and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as “National Flag Week” and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2021, as Flag Day, and the week starting June 13, 2021, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor the American spirit, to celebrate our history and the foundational values we strive to uphold, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.</FP>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        Older Americans make invaluable contributions to our families, our communities, and our Nation every day. But for far too many, the sacred promise of aging with dignity in America is broken by unconscionable incidents of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 
        <PRTPAGE P="151"/>
        Americans of all ages join the international community to raise awareness and help bring an end to elder abuse.
    </FP>
    <FP>Elder abuse can take many forms, including financial, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as exploitation and neglect. Every year, one in ten Americans aged 60 and older experiences abuse—and for every case of elder abuse that comes to the attention of authorities, it is estimated that 23 cases are never brought to light. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also seen a chilling increase in hate crimes targeting Asian-Americans, many of whom have been elders. These attacks are shameful and deeply un-American.</FP>
    <FP>Central to our Nation is the idea that we are all in this together, and that as Americans we owe one another a basic duty of care. The pandemic has both reinforced the importance of that duty and tested our capacity to meet it—the virus has exacerbated the quiet harm of social isolation among seniors around the world, a condition that makes abuse, neglect, and exploitation more likely. Having lost so many cherished seniors to this virus, we must recommit ourselves to fully including older Americans in our communities and systems of support. We must care for one another—and leave no one behind.</FP>
    <FP>With over three-quarters of Americans 65 and over now fully vaccinated and more progress being made every day, the future for seniors is growing brighter and brighter. After a painful year, grandparents around the world are hugging their grandchildren again. Vaccinated seniors who were socially isolated are able to reengage with the broader community again. And as we begin to build back better, we are working to ensure that older Americans have greater opportunities to live with dignity, safety, independence, and social connections.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to fulfilling that promise. That's why the American Rescue Plan included more than $1.4 billion in additional funding for programs that promote community living and ensure the safety and protection of older adults. The law also enhances the Elder Justice Act and ensures that Adult Protective Services can be used to protect the safety and dignity of all seniors. Additionally, the plan included new Medicaid funding to expand access to critical home and community-based health care services, and over $275 million for elder justice programs that address abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan will further that progress, building up the care infrastructure that our economy and so many families depend on—expanding day programs for seniors, programs that bring care workers to seniors' homes to cook meals, and programs to help seniors get around their home safely and live more independently.</FP>
    <FP>
        As we expand opportunities for older Americans, my Administration will also not tolerate elder abuse or hate in any form. I have instructed agencies across the Federal Government to do their part to combat elder abuse and support survivors. We are working to renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, which also dedicates Federal funds to develop a more comprehensive approach to addressing abuse and neglect in later life, including through the funding of victim service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors working to prevent and respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking experienced by older adults, whether caused by a spouse, family member, caregiver, or others. And this year, for the first 
        <PRTPAGE P="152"/>
        time, the Federal Government has provided funding to Adult Protective Services programs in every State and Territory to support their critical, on-the-ground work investigating abuse and connecting victims to resources.
    </FP>
    <FP>During World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we also recognize the individuals who dedicate themselves to preventing elder abuse. All across our Nation, caregivers work to help older adults stay connected to their communities while preventing elder abuse and intervening if it occurs. These unsung heroes include family members, Adult Protective Services workers, social service providers, nonprofit victim services organizations, long-term care ombudspersons, law enforcement officers, judges and judicial personnel, legal professionals, health care professionals, and financial professionals.</FP>
    <FP>On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we stand with all older Americans, and elderly people around the world, who are victims of elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation, and we recommit ourselves to protecting every senior's right to live their golden years with dignity and respect.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2021, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to work for elder justice by building inclusive communities that welcome people of all ages and abilities; by learning the warning signs of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; and by challenging age-related biases.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On June 19, 1865—nearly nine decades after our Nation's founding, and more than 2 years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation—enslaved Americans in Galveston, Texas, finally received word that they were free from bondage. As those who were formerly enslaved were recognized for the first time as citizens, Black Americans came to commemorate Juneteenth with celebrations across the country, building new lives and a new tradition that we honor today. In its celebration of freedom, Juneteenth is a day that should be recognized by all Americans. And that is why I am proud to have consecrated Juneteenth as our newest national holiday.</FP>
    <FP>Juneteenth is a day of profound weight and power.</FP>
    <FP>
        A day in which we remember the moral stain and terrible toll of slavery on our country—what I've long called America's original sin. A long legacy of systemic racism, inequality, and inhumanity.
        <PRTPAGE P="153"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>But it is a day that also reminds us of our incredible capacity to heal, hope, and emerge from our darkest moments with purpose and resolve.</FP>
    <FP>As I said on the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, great nations don't ignore the most painful chapters of their past. Great nations confront them. We come to terms with them.</FP>
    <FP>On Juneteenth, we recommit ourselves to the work of equity, equality, and justice. And, we celebrate the centuries of struggle, courage, and hope that have brought us to this time of progress and possibility. That work has been led throughout our history by abolitionists and educators, civil rights advocates and lawyers, courageous activists and trade unionists, public officials, and everyday Americans who have helped make real the ideals of our founding documents for all.</FP>
    <FP>There is still more work to do. As we emerge from the long, dark winter of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, racial equity remains at the heart of our efforts to vaccinate the Nation and beat the virus. We must recognize that Black Americans, among other people of color, have shouldered a disproportionate burden of loss—while also carrying us through disproportionately as essential workers and health care providers on the front lines of the crisis.</FP>
    <FP>Psalm 30 proclaims that “weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and discrimination, and the promise of a brighter morning to come. My Administration is committed to building an economy—and a Nation—that brings everyone along, and finally delivers our Nation's founding promise to Black Americans. Together, we will lay the roots of real and lasting justice, so that we can become the extraordinary country that was promised to all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>Juneteenth not only commemorates the past. It calls us to action today.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2021, as Juneteenth Day of Observance.

    <FP>Like so many fathers, my dad was a man of decency, honor, generosity, and kindness. He had a profound impact on me, and instilled in me the understanding of the basic truth that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. The value set my father taught me, I taught to my children and my grandchildren. I hold his words, his wisdom, and his influence in my heart every day and every time I sign my name as President, Joseph R. Biden, Jr.</FP>
    <FP>Father's Day is a time to recognize, appreciate, and celebrate the fathers and father figures in our lives who lift us up on their shoulders and shape our lives for the better. We thank the dads who have guided, taught, coached, cared for us, and supported us through life's trials and tribulations. And, we celebrate all that they impart: character and perspective, lessons borne from experience, and the sacrifices made from love.</FP>
    <FP>We also know this can be a hard day for many—for those who have lost a father, a grandfather, a stepfather, or a fatherly role model; and for those fathers who have lost a child of their own. During the past year, too many families lost fathers too soon because of and during this pandemic. We think of them today and every day, and we honor their enduring memories and legacies.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to strengthening American families and easing the burdens of caregiving, so that more fathers and mothers can raise children while pursuing fulfilling lives and careers of their own. The American Families Plan would provide 12 weeks of paid family leave, so that all parents who work outside the home can spend precious time with their newborn children or care for their children and other loved ones when they get sick. By investing in our caregiving infrastructure, we can help ensure that no father or mother has to choose between putting food on the table or caring for their children. My Administration is also committed to helping single moms and dads, many of whom shoulder all of the parenting responsibility in their children's lives, sacrificing greatly to ensure that their kids have the same opportunities as everyone else.</FP>
    <FP>Today, we express our appreciation for the fathers, stepfathers, grandfathers, and father figures who enrich our character, love us unconditionally, and give so much of themselves every day so we can live lives worthy of their dreams and sacrifices.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 20, 2021, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day. Let us remember our fathers, living and deceased, and give them the honor and gratitude they deserve.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">50th Anniversary of the 26th AmendmentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Our Constitution recognizes that, as a Nation, we are constantly learning. Our Founders built that recognition into its original design, providing a mechanism to amend our Constitution as our Nation evolved. On July 1, 1971, our Nation ratified the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, lowering the voting age to 18. At the time, 18-, 19-, and 20-year-old Americans were fulfilling their civic duties: paying taxes, serving in our Armed Forces, acting as first responders, laboring in fields, factories, and service jobs across the country, and pursuing higher education. They were participating in our democracy and all of the responsibilities of citizenship in all ways except for one:  they could not vote. A broad coalition, following in the footsteps of the suffragettes of the early 20th century and the civil rights activists of the 1960s, advocated, educated, and prevailed in persuading our Nation that those younger Americans were entitled to the right to vote. We also made a national commitment that the right to vote would never be denied or abridged for any adult voter based on their age.</FP>
    <FP>My first race for the Senate was one of the first elections in which 18-year-olds could vote, and the energy and passion of Delaware's young people helped propel me to an unlikely victory.</FP>
    <FP>Fifty years later, younger voters remain essential to our civic infrastructure. They are not only voting in ourelections—including at record rates in 2020—but winning them. Younger Americans are lending their talent and vision to school boards, city councils, and county commissions; teenagers are serving as State legislators and mayors, and we are the better for it.</FP>
    <FP>Younger voters are not waiting to inherit the future; they are building the future themselves. Young Americans have been on the front lines in the fight to defend the right to vote and expand access to the ballot box for all eligible voters. Their civic engagement extends beyond voting—with young Americans leading the calls for racial justice, climate action, gun violence prevention, and immigration reform among many other issues.</FP>
    <FP>
        Despite the progress we have made, there remain persistent gaps in turnout between younger voters and their older counterparts. There is still more that we can and must do to deliver on the promise of the 26th Amendment. My Administration has made public service and civic education a priority, engaging younger Americans in our shared struggle for continual progress. I have directed Federal agencies to consider ways to make it easier to vote and to learn about voting, and to focus on the various ways that the Federal Government engages younger Americans, online and off. Today's youth are 
        <PRTPAGE P="156"/>
        more diverse than past generations—and laws aimed at suppressing voter turnout in Black and Brown communities also impact young voters. My Administration supports the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the fundamental right to vote and make our democracy more equitable and accessible for all Americans.
    </FP>
    <FP>Today, we honor the bipartisan expansion of voter enfranchisement. Let us continue our work to make the 26th Constitutional Amendment ever more meaningful in the months and years ahead.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 1, 2021, as the 50th Anniversary of the 26th Amendment. I call upon all Americans to participate in ceremonies and activities that honor the 26th formal modification of our national Charter, that recognize the contributions made by voters enfranchised by its terms, and that work toward full participation of all who are eligible to vote.</FP>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Atomic Veterans Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On July 16, 1945, the United States detonated the world's first nuclear device in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Better known by its code name, “Trinity,” the successful test of the first atomic bomb brought forth a new age of science that changed the lives of many of those who served in our Armed Forces, and forever altered the nature and the risks of war. Just weeks later, the world witnessed the horrors of nuclear destruction at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which marked the end of World War II but opened our eyes to the truth that a nuclear war must never be fought.</FP>
    <FP>
        Many brave men and women have risked their lives in service to our Nation, but few know the story of our “Atomic Veterans”—American military service members who participated in nuclear tests between 1945 and 1962, served with United States military forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki through mid-1946, or were held as prisoners of war in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These veterans served at testing sites like the Bikini Atoll and witnessed the destructive power of nuclear weapons firsthand. On National Atomic Veterans Day, we recognize and honor the contributions of America's Atomic Veterans for their sacrifice and dedication to our Nation's security, and recommit to supporting our Atomic Veterans and educating ourselves on the role these patriots played in our national story.
        <PRTPAGE P="157"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Atomic Veterans served our Nation with distinction, but their service came at a great cost. Many developed health conditions due to radiation exposure, yet because they were not able to discuss the nature of their service, they were unable to seek medical care or disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their illnesses. Decades later in 1996, the United States Congress repealed the Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act, allowing Atomic Veterans to tell their stories and file for benefits. By then, thousands of Atomic Veterans had died without their families knowing the true extent of their service.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation has one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm's way, and to care for them and their families when they return from service. As Commander in Chief, I am committed to fulfilling our obligation to the Atomic Veterans and their families, and ensuring that all of our Nation's veterans have timely access to needed services, medical care, and benefits.</FP>
    <FP>On this National Atomic Veterans Day, our country remembers the service and sacrifices of Atomic Veterans. Their heroism and patriotism will never be forgotten and we always honor their bravery and devotion to duty.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 16, 2021, as National Atomic Veterans Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor our Nation's Atomic Veterans whose brave service and sacrifice played an important role in the defense of our Nation.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Captive Nations Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        From the founding of our Nation to today, through the crucibles of war and the struggle of successive generations, America has strived to uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy upon which our country was built and expand the ability of people around the world to freely exercise their rights. As the world's longest-standing democracy, we carry a special responsibility to lead at home and abroad, not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example—to prove to ourselves and to the world that democracy can deliver for all people. Though much has changed in the world since President Eisenhower issued the first Captive Nations Proclamation in 1959, its call for liberty and opportunity still ring true. During Captive Nations Week, we recommit ourselves to those principles 
        <PRTPAGE P="158"/>
        which form the foundation of our Nation, and to amplify the voices of courageous individuals around the world who are striving to advance the principles of human rights, justice, and the rule of law.
    </FP>
    <FP>Today, far too many people are subject to routine abuses of power, as oppressive governments detain, harass, or commit acts of violence against dissenting voices; disseminate disinformation and propaganda; undermine democratic systems; and otherwise violate the public trust. These abuses are not new—but they remain as stern a threat to human rights and freedom as they have ever been.</FP>
    <FP>No nation or person of conscience can ignore the voices of those crying out for liberty. We hear Belarusians peacefully calling for democratic elections, and the courageous people of Hong Kong demanding the autonomy and liberty promised by Beijing under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and Hong Kong's Basic Law. We hear millions of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang, China, who have been unjustly interned and subject to surveillance and forced labor. We hear the determination of those rejecting military rule in Burma, resisting dictatorship in Venezuela, taking to streets in Cuba to demand freedom in the face of brutal state repression, and pressing for free and fair elections in Nicaragua—as well as the Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians, and other ethnic and religious minorities who suffer repression for opposing Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea.</FP>
    <FP>The American creed, which defines our Nation, proclaims that all people are created equal, and deserve to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, throughout their lives. We stand in solidarity with the brave human rights activists and pro-democracy advocates around the world who risk their lives for the rights of others. We are committed to ensuring that all those who are oppressed across the globe—including people with disabilities, women and girls, members of the LGBTQI+ community, indigenous populations, and racial and ethnic minorities—are heard, respected, and protected.</FP>
    <FP>During Captive Nations Week, we recommit ourselves to the timeless, vital work of advancing freedom and justice for all.</FP>
    <FP>We do that by forging a more equitable and inclusive society, by solving problems and helping to ease the burdens people face, and by fulfilling our role as a global leader for human rights and fundamental freedoms of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and religion or belief. Together with our allies and partners, we must continue to strengthen democratic institutions, defend independent civil society and media freedom, promote free and fair elections, protect human rights online, insist on accountability for those who commit abuses and foster cultures of corruption, and push back against authoritarianism around the world.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as “Captive Nations Week.”</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 18 through July 24, 2021, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to championing those around the world who strive for liberty and justice for all.

    <EAR>Proc. 10234</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Made in America Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Made in America Week recognizes a basic idea: when we spend taxpayer dollars, we should buy American products and support American jobs. The Congress passed the Buy American Act almost 90 years ago, but we have never fully lived up to this principle.</FP>
    <FP>During Made in America Week, we recognize that just as American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, American products and services must be part of the engine of American prosperity today. We also reject the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we cannot have good-paying union jobs here in America.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is making “Buy American” a policy, not just a promise. We are closing loopholes and strengthening standards to ensure that the future is made in all of America—by all of America's workers—in every region, of every background, in services, manufacturing, and agriculture.</FP>
    <FP>That is why one of my first acts as President was to sign an Executive Order to tighten existing Buy American policies, and to lay out additional commitments to prevent big corporations and special interests from using loopholes to redirect American taxpayer dollars to foreign companies. And, I have named our Nation's first-ever Made in America Director at our Office of Management and Budget.</FP>
    <FP>When we Buy American, we will buy from all of America. We will include communities that have historically been left out of Government procurement, Black, Brown, and Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a federally funded, national network called the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to help government agencies connect with new domestic suppliers across the country.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our need for greater manufacturing capacity in areas critical to public health, information and communications technology, and national defense.</FP>
    <FP>
        To build our economy back better, we must have an industrial strategy based on public investment in new technologies, including the domestic production of clean energy goods, critical medical supplies, and the innovative industries of the future. We must prioritize the creation of high skill, high value jobs that empower workers and pay family-supporting wages. We must reject short-termism, offshoring, and a race to the bottom. That 
        <PRTPAGE P="160"/>
        is why my Administration is committed to using Made in America policies that give America's workers and companies the tools they need to compete and lead globally for decades to come.
    </FP>
    <FP>We will send clear market signals so that entrepreneurs make the investments our Nation needs. We will ensure that Made in America preferences are applied consistently and transparently. We will gather data to reveal gaps in our industrial base, and work to close those gaps and boost our economy's productive capacity. And we will ensure that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility are at the center of all of these efforts.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration will maximize the Federal Government's use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States. These purchases will maximize our efforts to empower workers and strengthen unionization, tackle the climate crisis, and build and rebuild critical supply chains so that we will never again have to rely on imports from unreliable trading partners to combat threats to our public health.</FP>
    <FP>We will also reduce the need for waivers from Made in America rules by creating incentives for private investment in domestic supply chains in critical industries.</FP>
    <FP>As we focus on “Made in America,” we are committed to strengthening relationships with allies and trading partners. Resilient supply chains must have built in redundancies—a health crisis or natural disaster in one location must never again threaten the global economy. We must work with our trading partners to promote equitable growth, protect workers' rights, and advance environmental justice globally.</FP>
    <FP>By using Made in America policies as one tool of many to rebuild our industrial base and strengthen critical supply chains, we will help put the American dream within reach for our Nation's families today, and for generations to come.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26 through July 30, 2021, as Made in America Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week and to celebrate with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The United States and the Republic of Korea are allies with a long history of shared sacrifice. In a call to defend freedom and democracy abroad, 1.8 million Americans joined the fight to protect our Korean Peninsula allies from the communist regimes in North Korea and The People's Republic of China. In 1953, after 3 years of violent combat and millions of casualties, an armistice was signed by representatives of the United States, The People's Republic of China, and North Korea. The armistice made possible the exchange of prisoners of war as well as an opportunity to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Almost 70 years later, that settlement still has not been reached, and the Korean Peninsula remains divided along the 38th parallel. Yet, the Republic of Korea has grown into a thriving, vibrant country, and the enduring relationship between our two nations has flourished through decades of peace. Today, we take this opportunity to honor, remember, and pay tribute to the Korean War veterans who fought to defend those universal values and freedoms that the people of South Korea enjoy today.</FP>
    <FP>American service members, along with our United Nations counterparts, fought through some of the most unforgiving terrain and weather conditions on the Korean Peninsula. Through searing summer heat, bitter winter cold, and torrential rains, our forces fought with relentless courage, resilience, and perseverance. In the mountains, valleys, and rice paddies, the battles fought and lives lost in Inchon, the Chosin Reservoir, Heartbreak Ridge, and the Pusan Perimeter, we remember their valor. Earlier this year, I had the great privilege of awarding the Medal of Honor to Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., USA (Ret.), a legend in the Army Ranger community, for his extraordinary selflessness and heroism during the Korean War in the Battle of Hill 205. His story, and those of all our veterans of the Korean War, remind every American the high price of freedom.</FP>
    <FP>We shall never forget the service members who made the ultimate sacrifice. On the National Mall at the Korean War Memorial, a Wall of Remembrance will be established to further honor and venerate the more than 36,000 American lives lost during the war, along with more than 7,000 Korean Augmentation to the United States Army soldiers who were killed in action. As a grateful Nation, we owe it to the families of the fallen to memorialize, commemorate, and pay tribute to the heroes who have given their lives for our Nation—and to uphold and honor the democratic values for which they fought. We must also always recognize the patriotism and service of our veterans and their families and caregivers, and uphold our sacred obligation to provide the support they need when they come home.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our commitment to protecting peace on the Korean Peninsula has endured and grown in the ensuing decades. We are immensely proud of our historic friendship and the trust we share with the Republic of Korea. The service and sacrifices of both our nations have left an indelible determination to sustain peace and promote regional stability. Training side-by-side with the Korean military, our Armed Forces abroad help keep the watch while proudly upholding the legacy of those serving before them. Our partnership 
        <PRTPAGE P="162"/>
        remains crucial to maintaining peace and stability today, and to expanding economic growth in a critical region of the world.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Thirty-one years ago, on July 26, 1990, our Nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This landmark law affirms and protects the fundamental rights of people with disabilities—the right to equal opportunity, economic self-sufficiency, independent living, and equitable participation in every aspect of American life. For more than three decades, the ADA has made our communities, our economy, and our country stronger and more vibrant. It has helped to uphold the dignity of the estimated 61 million Americans who live with a disability—in short, it is a triumph of American civil rights.</FP>
    <FP>I was enormously proud to co-sponsor the ADA, the passage of which was a testament not only to fearless advocacy, but to bipartisan progress. A Democratic bill signed by a Republican President, the ADA was made possible thanks in no small part to the passion and persistence of Senators Tom Harkin and Ted Kennedy and Congressmen Major Owens and Tony Coelho. I will never forget the moment just after the ADA's passage, when Senator Harkin delivered a speech in American Sign Language from the Senate floor—a tribute to his older brother, Frank, who was deaf. That moment was an emotional reminder for all of us of just how personal and powerful the passage of the ADA would be for millions of American families.</FP>
    <FP>
        Despite the extraordinary progress we have made over the past 31 years, the fight for equitable access and inclusion is far from over. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the longstanding inequities and biases that exist for people with disabilities; persistent discrimination and the inability to access services continues to threaten the health and well-being of far too many Americans. Throughout the pandemic, people with disabilities have faced heightened risks—particularly those who lack access to caregiver or 
        <PRTPAGE P="163"/>
        support services, those who live in community homes, and the disproportionate share of people with disabilities employed in industries that suffered due to the pandemic. Children and students living with disabilities have also faced an especially challenging year, forced to navigate and adapt to online learning as the virus upended their usual school routines.
    </FP>
    <FP>As we work to finish the job of defeating COVID-19, my Administration is committed to building on the legacy of the ADA. The American Rescue Plan is providing funding to expand access to home- and community-based services under Medicaid, which will allow more people with disabilities to live safely and independently in their homes. My Build Back Better agenda would build on this by making significant investments in home- and community-based services for people with disabilities and older Americans. It will also spur the creation of quality jobs with good pay, good benefits, and the ability to organize and collectively bargain for caregivers.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also committed to advancing the rights of people with disabilities in the workplace to support economic self-sufficiency. I have proposed eliminating outdated provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act that allow employers to pay workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage. My proposal includes funding this transition with $2 billion to expand access to competitive, integrated employment opportunities for workers with disabilities. In addition, I am committed to making the Federal Government a model employer—including for people with disabilities—to set the gold standard for how best to support inclusion and provide appropriate accommodations. To that end, I recently signed an Executive Order to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the Federal Workforce—a pledge to lead by example to promote economic stability and good paying jobs for Americans with disabilities.</FP>
    <FP>Before I became President, I promised that every policy my Administration pursued—from rebuilding our middle class, to fighting climate change, to achieving universal health coverage—would be created with the full inclusion and dignity of Americans with disabilities in mind. I am proud to say that since my first day in office, my Administration has delivered on that promise. As we celebrate the monumental legacy of the ADA, we recommit ourselves today to upholding and strengthening its protections—and continuing to advance equity, dignity, access, and inclusion together with the disability community as we build our Nation back better.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2021, the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 31st year of this civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with disabilities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Health Center Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In 1965, our Nation launched its first community health centers to improve the lives and well-being of Americans regardless of their ability to pay. These health centers were a key component of President Lyndon B. Johnson's “Great Society” series of policy initiatives to eliminate poverty and racial injustice, and today serve as the bedrock on which our public health system was built. Today, health centers are one of the largest health care providers in the country and provide high-quality affordable, accessible, and value-based primary health care services to 29 million Americans each year—approximately 1 in 11 people across the country. They have also been a vital part of our Nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of National Health Center Week, we recognize the importance of federally-supported health centers and the role they play as a beacon of strength, service, and care in our communities.</FP>
    <FP>Health centers integrate medical, dental, and behavioral health care services into a single “health home” and consistently yield strong patient outcomes. Health centers also play a critical role in reducing racial and ethnic, geographic, socioeconomic, and other health disparities in the United States. They are invaluable to ensuring that our Nation's underserved populations, especially individuals and families living in poverty, rural communities, and communities of color are able to receive the care they need and deserve.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger because of our health centers, and the tireless, dedicated health center employees who continue to deliver critical services such as COVID-19 testing, treatment, and prevention services on the front lines. As we ramped up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines over the past several months, health centers, through the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program, have vaccinated and built vaccine confidence in millions of Americans from hard-hit and high-risk communities. Two-thirds of individuals vaccinated at health centers so far identify as racial and ethnic minorities. Health centers have also offered greater flexibility during the pandemic by expanding telehealth services to those in need.</FP>
    <FP>I believe that health care in America should be a right, not a privilege. No one should have to lay awake at night staring at the ceiling wondering what they are going to do to get the care they need or to pay the bills if a family member gets sick. That is why I will do everything in my power to ensure that all Americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve—and the peace of mind it brings.</FP>

        In support of that goal, my Administration is committed to expanding health centers and increasing access to their life-saving services. That is why we invested more than $7.6 billion to help health centers prevent and respond to COVID-19 and improve health care services—including over $1 billion for major infrastructure and renovation projects at health centers across the country through the American Rescue Plan. I am also committed 
        <PRTPAGE P="165"/>
        to doubling the Federal investment in community health centers to further expand access to care and make strides in our pursuit of health equity.
    </FP>
    <FP>During National Health Center Week, we recognize the importance of health centers and their staff who heal and strengthen our local communities. We salute their dedication and service. As our Nation builds back better, we commit to working together to bring about a stronger, healthier Nation for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 8 through August 14, 2021, as National Health Center Week.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since our founding, courageous men and women have vowed to serve and defend our country, protect our citizens, and uphold the principles of our Constitution. The citizen Soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard, and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen of the Reserve, proudly carry on this tradition today. During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we thank and celebrate the civilian employers whose support of our National Guard and Reserve members helps to sustain our all-volunteer force and our national spirit of service.</FP>
    <FP>National Guard and Reserve members are essential to the safety and security of our Nation, ready to serve at home or abroad at any moment's notice. From working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, to responding to storm damage and raging wildfires, to deploying overseas, supporting peacekeeping missions abroad, and conducting multilateral exercises with allies and partner nations, National Guard and Reserve members put their lives on hold—away from both their families and their civilian workplaces—to stand as a shield or a support whenever our country is in need. When they complete their mission, National Guard and Reserve members return to their civilian careers and fulfill their obligation of monthly weekend drills and annual trainings—always ensuring they are ready to answer the next call to serve.</FP>
    <FP>
        We owe a profound gratitude to our National Guard and Reserve members, as well as their civilian employers. In supporting their talented employees' service to our Nation, employers of National Guard and Reserve members directly contribute to our military readiness and our national security. As our Guard and Reserve members navigate the challenges that accompany 
        <PRTPAGE P="166"/>
        their service, many civilian employers go above and beyond to support our service members and their families. National Guard and Reserve members should not have to worry about their civilian employment while they are serving on a mission, and many employers are stepping up with generous pay and leave policies, extension of benefits like health care for family members, and flexibility and support for Guard and Reserve spouses to help fulfill our sacred obligation as a Nation to always take care of those who serve in uniform.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration understands the national security imperative behind improving the well-being of our service members and their families as they balance the pressures of their civilian careers with the demands of military service. Through the First Lady's work with Joining Forces, we are committed to supporting military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors through economic and entrepreneurship opportunities, support for military child education, and health and well-being resources. Ensuring continuing economic opportunities for military and veteran families through meaningful employment is essential, and we are grateful for all of the employers who understand the value in hiring and retaining National Guard and Reserve members and their spouses.</FP>
    <FP>The Biden family is a National Guard family, and we are forever grateful and in awe of those who, like our son Beau, understand that duty and service to others is what makes us who we are as Americans. We understand some of the unique challenges that National Guard and Reserve members and their families face—challenges that are made smaller because of the incredible, patriotic support of their employers. I encourage all Americans to join me in recognizing and thanking employers of our National Guard and Reserve members for their vast contributions to our economy, our communities, and the success of our Nation and our Armed Forces. I also encourage National Guard and Reserve members to recognize their employers who have gone above and beyond in supporting them with the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), the Department of Defense program that promotes cooperation and understanding between civilian employers and their National Guard and Reserve employees.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 15 through August 21, 2021, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I call upon the people of the United States, State and local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to honor employers of National Guard and Reserve members with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Women's Equality Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, we celebrate Women's Equality Day, a reminder not only of the progress women have won through the years, but of the important work that remains to be done.  One hundred and one years ago, the ratification of the 19th Amendment moved our Nation one essential step closer to fulfilling its foundational promise—establishing at long last that no American's right to vote could be denied or abridged on the basis of gender.  As we reflect on the decades-long effort to win the fight for universal suffrage, we also remember the women of color who helped lead the movement to ratify the 19th Amendment, whose own rights would still be denied for years to come despite their hard-earned victory.  We celebrate their extraordinary courage and resolve, and rededicate ourselves to the work we still have ahead of us to protect voting rights across our country.</FP>
    <FP>When the 19th Amendment was ratified, millions of women across the country could finally make their voices heard at the ballot box.  But even with its ratification, millions were denied those rights by law or by practice through poll taxes, literacy tests, and campaigns of violence and terror that targeted voters of color.  It took another 45 years before the Voting Rights Act secured the voting rights of millions of Americans of color, and an additional 10 years before voting protections would reflect the many languages Americans speak.</FP>
    <FP>Through these measures and others, our country has taken major strides to strengthen voting rights and expand access to make it easier for Americans to exercise their sacred right to vote.  These victories have been especially vital for women, who often face increased caregiving demands and take on a disproportionate amount of low-wage and inflexible work—making it harder to take time off to vote in-person or wait out longer lines at the polls.  Women are also disproportionately impacted by voter ID laws—especially married women who change their names, or those whose IDs do not accurately reflect their gender.</FP>
    <FP>Efforts to improve voting access have paid off; in 2020, we witnessed the greatest number of votes ever cast in American history.  And one barrier that had stood for more than two centuries was finally dismantled with the inauguration of America's first woman Vice President, Kamala Harris.</FP>
    <FP>But the struggle to ensure that every American is able to exercise their right to vote continues, especially for women of color.  In the years prior to the 2020 election and in the months since, we have seen a wave of shameless attacks on voting—burdening a constitutional right with obstacles that overwhelmingly impact voters of color, low-income communities, and people with disabilities.  These tactics are nothing new.  But they are an affront to our most cherished values and rights as a Nation.</FP>
    <FP>
        As I have said before, some things in America should be simple and straightforward.  Perhaps the most important—the most fundamental—is the right to vote and to vote freely.  With it, anything is possible.  Without it, nothing is.
        <PRTPAGE P="168"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to bearing out the promise of the suffragists, who understood that for women to attain true equality in our country, they must have an equal place at the ballot box.  As the Vice President has said, the status of women is the status of democracy.  This is true abroad, too, where we are committed to strengthening women's political participation and leadership around the world.</FP>
    <FP>In fulfillment of my Administration's commitment to equality for all, we are focused not only on the sacred right to vote, but on making sure that all Americans have the opportunity to fully participate in our society.  It is long past time we pass the Equal Rights Amendment, to enshrine the principle of gender equality in our Constitution, because no one's rights should be denied on account of sex.  On Women's Equality Day, we recognize the unique challenges and barriers women face, and the rights that need defending and strengthening.  These rights include a woman's constitutional right to reproductive freedom and access to health care, regardless of zip code or income—and the right of every woman and girl to live free from violence, whether online, in the home, at school, or in the workplace.  To ensure that women are treated fairly in our economy and in the workforce, we are also committed to fighting for pay equity, combating discrimination in the workplace, and passing family-friendly policies that help women and all of us manage caregiving and career responsibilities.</FP>
    <FP>Today, as we celebrate Women's Equality Day, we recognize the pioneers whose fight for suffrage paved the way for future generations of leaders—and we recognize our duty to continue that fight to ensure that our daughters can enjoy the same rights and opportunities as our sons.  Let us honor the efforts of trailblazers and barrier-breakers with meaningful action to promote gender equality and make exercising the right to vote more equitable and accessible for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2021, as Women's Equality Day.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Overdose Awareness Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The overdose epidemic has taken a toll on far too many Americans and their loved ones. Addiction is a disease that touches families in every community, including my own. The epidemic is national, but the impact is personal. It is personal to the millions who confront substance use disorder every day, and to the families who have lost loved ones to an overdose.</FP>
    <FP>During Overdose Awareness Week, we recommit to taking bold actions to prevent overdoses and related deaths, and enhance our support for individuals with substance use disorders.</FP>
    <FP>In recent years, we have seen synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl, drive many overdose deaths with cocaine- and methamphetamine-related deaths also increasing at alarming rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the overdose epidemic, as necessary pandemic restrictions made it harder for individuals with addiction to receive the treatment and support services they need. These factors contributed to the more than 93,000 drug overdose deaths in 2020. As a Nation, we need a strong response to America's overdose epidemic and an investment in prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery services, as well as strategies to reduce the supply of illicit drugs.</FP>
    <FP>
        While drug overdose and addiction affect many different communities across the United States, we also recognize the longstanding inequities experienced by people of color, people who identify as LGBTQ+, formerly incarcerated individuals, people experiencing homelessness, and others. For too many years, these communities have faced disparate access to health care, differential treatment in the criminal justice system, and poorer health outcomes.
        <PRTPAGE P="170"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to addressing addiction and the overdose epidemic with evidence-based strategies. In April, to ensure that the Federal Government is promoting evidence-based public health and safety interventions, the Office of National Drug Control Policy released my Administration's first year drug policy priorities. These include expanding access to prevention, treatment and harm reduction efforts, reducing youth substance use, reducing the supply of illicit substances, advancing recovery-ready workplaces, and expanding the addiction workforce and access to recovery support services for all Americans. My Administration is also committed to eliminating racial disparities in responding to the overdose epidemic as well as reviewing the overall approach to drug policy.</FP>
    <FP>This effort requires significant investments in our health care infrastructure. In my American Rescue Plan, we provided crucial funding for substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction, including a nearly $4 billion investment in our Nation's behavioral health infrastructure. This includes $30 million for a new Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grant program to support community-based efforts aimed at preventing overdoses and reducing harm associated with substance use.</FP>
    <FP>We also recognize that many of our brave veterans recovering from service injuries may be vulnerable to opioid addiction. I signed the Dispose Unused Medications and Prescription Opioids Act to ensure that Veterans Affairs facilities provide locations to dispose controlled substances in a safe, secure and supportive environment.</FP>
    <FP>Agencies across the Federal Government are also making significant strides in supporting individuals with substance use disorders. The Department of Health and Human Services continues to work on expanding access to evidence-based treatment, including a new policy to expand access to buprenorphine, a medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The Drug Enforcement Administration also issued a new rule that allows more opioid use disorder treatment programs to operate mobile components to better serve rural and underserved communities. These actions are only the beginning. My Administration will be taking additional actions to reduce barriers to life-saving treatment and expand access to prevention, harm reduction, and recovery support services.</FP>
    <FP>Overdose Awareness Week provides us an opportunity to recommit ourselves to addressing this epidemic. By enhancing our support for individuals facing substance use disorder we can save lives.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 29 through September 4, 2021, as Overdose Awareness Week. I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness of substance use disorders to combat stigma, to promote treatment and celebrate recovery, and to strengthen our collective efforts to prevent overdose deaths. August 31st also marks Overdose Awareness Day, on which our Nation mourns the lives lost to the drug overdose epidemic.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For millions of American families—including my own—the fight against cancer is personal. When a person you love is diagnosed with cancer, it stops your heart and throws your world off of its axis. That fear and heartache is only compounded when cancer strikes a child.</FP>
    <FP>Across America, thousands of courageous children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer each year are facing life-threatening struggles. They are cared for by loving families, friends, volunteers, and health care teams who band together to support our most vulnerable patients as they face their cancer journey. During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the young lives taken too soon, as well as the growing number of young cancer survivors, some of whom may face serious health challenges throughout their lifetimes. We recognize the remarkable progress made in treatment and survivorship, and rededicate ourselves to the development of more effective therapies so that all children have the chance to live long and healthy lives.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the extraordinary advancements medical science has made in recent years, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States—and the leading cause of death by disease for American children between infancy and age 15. Cancer is cruel and spares no age. It inflicts an incalculable toll on young patients and their loved ones. Though improvement has been made in some areas, survival rates for all childhood cancers remain too low. A growing number of childhood cancer survivors are experiencing longer life expectancies, but far too many continue to face significant long-term physical, emotional, and cognitive effects due to their cancer and treatment. As a Nation, we must do more to better understand the causes of pediatric cancer, improve treatment, and enhance the lifelong well-being of survivors.</FP>
    <FP>When I lost my son Beau to cancer after his courageous fight, I buried a part of my soul deep in the Earth. Too many families know that feeling too well—at any age, it leaves a black hole in your heart. In 2016, President Obama and I created the Cancer Moonshot Initiative to end cancer as we know it. Now, as President, I remain committed to that mission—and I will continue to invest in the critical research and care needed to defeat this devastating disease. That is why I am asking the Congress to launch the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health—or ARPA-H—at the National Institutes of Health, to develop breakthroughs that prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other deadly diseases.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation is already seeing the progress of investing in pediatric cancer research and technology. We are improving our understanding of pediatric 
        <PRTPAGE P="172"/>
        cancers that are particularly difficult to treat, and extending the promise of immune-based treatments for children and adolescents. We are seeing advancements in precision medicine approaches to treating childhood cancers—including progress on understanding how tumors respond to existing therapies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is leading the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, which brings together the Nation's childhood cancer research, advocacy, and care communities to ensure that we “learn from every child” with cancer by consistently gathering data in a way that protects patient privacy while allowing for rapid sharing of insights among researchers. This will enable us to accelerate progress and deliver effective treatments and cures to more children. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration's Pediatric Oncology program works with stakeholders to accelerate and support the timely, efficient development of safe and effective new drugs and biological products to treat cancers in children.
    </FP>
    <FP>Many parents and family members feel terrified and overwhelmed following a child's cancer diagnosis. To support families and pediatric caretakers, the NCI has resources available, including online and print materials and videos, to help families understand treatment options and provide information to help them navigate the cancer journey. Visit www.cancer.gov to learn more or talk to trained information specialists with the NCI Cancer Information Service in the United States at 1-800-4-CANCER.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also committed to protecting childhood cancer patients and their families through the Affordable Care Act, which provides critical protections for individuals facing cancer, including children. Because of the Affordable Care Act, most insurance companies are now prohibited from limiting or denying coverage to young cancer patients participating in clinical research studies. And children who have recovered from cancer can no longer be denied insurance coverage based on the fact that they have a pre-existing condition.</FP>
    <FP>During National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we pay tribute to the health care professionals, researchers, private philanthropies, social support organizations, and patient advocacy groups who work together with families across the country to provide hope and help to children diagnosed with cancer and to develop better treatments. Together, we will carry on their work—and build a future in which cancer no longer threatens the lives of our Nation's children.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to support the fight against childhood cancer.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every year, thousands of women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Like all cancers, ovarian cancer is brutal and cruel, inflicting pain and hardship for women and their families. Like so many families, my family and I know the pain of cancer all too well. During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the courage of those affected by ovarian cancer and renew our commitment to fighting this illness that takes the lives of far too many women. We also recommit to improving and promoting early cancer detection, investing in cancer research, and ensuring that every woman has equitable access to the care they need and deserve.</FP>
    <FP>Ovarian cancer is rare and deadly. Because there is no early ovarian cancer screening test, many women are diagnosed with this disease at an advanced stage. And despite ovarian cancer rates being highest among white women, Black women are more likely to die from this disease because of lack of access to health care, socioeconomic disparities, and other causes still under study.</FP>
    <FP>
        To help women understand the risk of developing ovarian cancer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides tools and resources to learn about the risk factors that increase the likelihood of being diagnosed with this disease. Risk factors for ovarian cancer include a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Any woman who thinks she is at risk of ovarian cancer or who experiences persistent symptoms, including abdominal or pelvic pain, pressure, swelling, or bloating should talk with her health care provider. The CDC's 
        <E T="03">Inside Knowledge about Gynecologic Cancer,</E>
         which includes resources for ovarian cancer, also helps women recognize the warning signs and seek medical care. To learn more about ovarian cancer, visit www.cancer.gov/types/ovarian and www.cdc.gov/cancer.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        The effort to eliminate ovarian cancer is taking place on all fronts, from laboratory research on cancer prevention, screening and early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care, to clinical research studies, clinical trials, and public health and awareness efforts. Through the leadership of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), scientists are focused on research to maintain and improve the quality and length of life for women with ovarian cancer. My Administration plans to build on these efforts by supporting investments in research and technology to develop new ways to detect ovarian cancer early, and improve treatment strategies. To push for these groundbreaking discoveries and innovative treatments, I have called for the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health at the NIH—or ARPA-H—which would invest $6.5 billion to develop breakthroughs that prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other deadly diseases. I am committed to doing everything I can to end cancer as we know it, and to bring together the human, financial, and knowledge resources necessary to make the breakthroughs that will dramatically advance our progress against cancer and deliver hope and health to the world.
        <PRTPAGE P="174"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also dedicated to protecting ovarian cancer patients through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Because of the ACA, insurance companies are banned from dropping a woman's coverage because she has a pre-existing condition such as ovarian cancer. The ACA also covers “well-woman visits” to a primary care physician and gynecologist that include a full checkup, with no copayments or deductibles. These visits focus on preventive care for women and may help detect ovarian cancer as early as possible.</FP>
    <FP>As we observe National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we are united in our goal to end ovarian cancer, and to improve the lives of all women carrying the burden of this disease—including the lives of their families and loved ones. We are also united in our support of the researchers, advocates, and health care professionals who are working tirelessly for new solutions to prevent, detect, and treat ovarian cancer, and to improve the overall health and well-being of all women.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon the women of the United States to speak with their doctors and health care providers to learn more about ovarian cancer. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to detect and treat ovarian cancer.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        In the past year, our Nation has faced both unpredictable and unprecedented challenges. The 2020 hurricane season was the most active on record. Severe winter storms and record-breaking heat waves interrupted our power sector, and the climate crisis fueled historic drought, water scarcity, and dangerous heat waves, which in turn have helped supercharge the wildfires ravaging the West. All of this has come on top of the ongoing pain and struggle of COVID-19, which has impacted every community across the Nation. Becoming more disaster-resilient as a country—and more prepared as a people—is essential for our continued strength and security. During National Preparedness Month, we encourage all Americans to take the important steps to prepare for natural and human-made threats and to ensure that all our communities are ready for any emergency.
        <PRTPAGE P="175"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to taking bold action to prepare for and address the dangers posed by climate change. We have put the climate crisis and the communities most vulnerable to it at the center of our domestic and foreign policy. We are investing in weather forecasting and climate research to strengthen our understanding of how our changing climate is altering severe weather and drought, and we are ensuring that every community has the resources to prepare for and respond to these increasingly dangerous storms. We are also investing in helping developing nations adapt and build their own resilience in the face of climate change.</FP>
    <FP>At home, we are making a once-in-a-generation investment in upgrading our infrastructure so that it is more resilient to the challenges of today, and we are mitigating climate change by building up an American-made clean power economy for tomorrow. That is why I am committed to making a historic commitment to resilience through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal to upgrade and modernize our power grid, invest in mass transit and vehicle electrification, and fund environmental cleanup.</FP>
    <FP>I am also rallying the world to join the United States in committing to greater climate ambition. The United States has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, and we are leading the charge for stronger global action to cut greenhouse gas pollution and avert the worst impacts of climate change while we still have the chance. The United States is leading by example and creating good, high-paying jobs in the process by harnessing the economic opportunities of climate action.</FP>
    <FP>As we prepare for natural disasters and address the accelerating climate crisis, we must also remain vigilant to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic and threats that will arise in the future. Even as more than 174 million Americans have been fully vaccinated—with hundreds of thousands continuing to get vaccinated each day—the more transmissible Delta variant is spreading, particularly among unvaccinated individuals. I continue to call on Americans to protect themselves and those around them by getting vaccinated. The vaccines are safe. They are effective. And together, we can save lives.</FP>
    <FP>The theme of this year's National Preparedness Month is “Prepare to Protect.” During the past year, natural disasters have sent our communities into turmoil, and we have seen the particularly devastating toll they take on disadvantaged, low-income communities and people of color. Beyond the physical damage done by natural disasters, these storms also exact an emotional toll on their victims, from the pain of losing a loved one to the pressure caused by financial setbacks. Therefore, we must all prepare to better protect ourselves and our communities against both immediate crises and their residual effects.</FP>
    <FP>During National Preparedness Month, we also recognize the bravery and the sacrifices of our first responders, who are our first line of defense in so many crises. This month, as we prepare to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we honor the lives that were lost and the heroism that was displayed by both first responders and ordinary citizens to respond, and we reaffirm our responsibility to never forget.</FP>
    <FP>
        This month, we must each do our part—we must all Prepare to Protect. I call on everyone to get vaccinated, turn on emergency alerts on your

        smartphone, pack an emergency go-bag, and encourage others in your community to do the same.

    <FP>National Preparedness Month is a call to action to all parts of our government, industrial and commercial sectors, academia, non-governmental organizations, civic groups, religious institutions, and families. By working together today, we can ensure that our Nation is prepared for the natural and human-made threats of tomorrow.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our resilience and readiness.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In 2021, over 248,500 Americans have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Even as we make tremendous advancements in cancer research and treatment, prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among our Nation's fathers, sons, husbands, and brothers. Today, one in eight men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime—often without any previous signs or symptoms. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we rededicate ourselves to supporting those diagnosed with prostate cancer through research, education, and access to prevention, treatment, and follow-up care and support. Together, we can increase awareness of this cancer, and improve the care and well-being of those impacted by this disease.</FP>
    <FP>
        Awareness of the risk factors of prostate cancer can help men make informed choices about their health with their primary health care providers—especially for men over the age of 65, men who have a family history of prostate cancer, and Black men who have a higher chance of developing and suffering from prostate cancer. I encourage all men and their families to learn the latest information on prostate cancer at www.cancer.gov/types/prostate and www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate. I also 
        <PRTPAGE P="177"/>
        encourage every American to get recommended cancer screenings, check-ups, and treatments from your health care providers. Most importantly, talk to your doctor about your risks for developing prostate cancer.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration continues to push for groundbreaking discoveries and innovative treatments to end cancer as we know it. That is why I am working to create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health at the National Institutes of Health—or ARPA-H—which would invest 6.5 billion dollars to develop breakthroughs that prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other deadly diseases.</FP>
    <FP>I am also committed to funding research to expand prevention and treatment of prostate cancer specifically. Today, researchers funded by the National Cancer Institute are working to advance our understanding of how to prevent, detect, and treat prostate cancer. The National Institutes of Health and partners in the private sector have launched the largest-ever coordinated research effort to investigate environmental and genetic factors related to prostate cancer to better understand why it disproportionately impacts Black men. And we are working on methods to prepare more advanced early detection tests and clinical trials to develop and enhance treatments for all men.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration will also continue to protect and fight to build on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the important protections it provides for all Americans, including for men with prostate cancer. The ACA prohibits insurance companies from restrictive annual dollar limits on benefits, and it prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to patients with prostate cancer—or any other pre-existing medical condition. The ACA also helps ensure that every man with prostate cancer receives quality health care.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation has made exceptional progress in the fight against cancer, and I am committed to doing everything I can to bring together the knowledge, as well as the human and financial resources necessary to advance that progress. We owe every person who has lost their battle with this disease, every person living with this disease, and every person who may one day be diagnosed with it, our continued work to defeat it. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, let us renew our efforts to save lives and spare suffering by accelerating our work to end cancer as we know it.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and cure prostate cancer.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Recovery Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an enormous toll on the lives of the American people, especially those struggling with substance use disorder. While many have continued on their path towards recovery, even while facing the additional physical, emotional, and economic hardships brought about by the pandemic, others have struggled. During National Recovery Month, we celebrate the millions of Americans who have achieved recovery and reaffirm our commitment to helping more Americans overcome substance use disorder and reach recovery. We also support those who are still struggling to achieve recovery and dedicate ourselves to overcoming these challenges together.</FP>
    <FP>This year's theme, “Recovery is For Everyone: Every Person, Every Family, Every Community,” emphasizes that recovery is possible for all Americans. My Administration honors the many pathways to recovery and will support individuals and their families at every step along their journey, in whatever form it takes. Everyone can support and encourage those working toward recovery.</FP>
    <FP>The work ahead includes making treatment and recovery support services accessible to all Americans. My American Rescue Plan delivered nearly $4 billion to strengthen and expand mental health and substance use disorder services. My Administration will also continue to work to expand employment opportunities for people in recovery and foster the development of recovery-ready workplace policies and cultures. Helping those in recovery to attain economic opportunity and mobility will not only improve their well-being but also benefit our Nation as a whole. These investments will lay the foundation upon which more Americans—of all backgrounds and in every community—can build and maintain long-term recovery.</FP>
    <FP>While opportunities for recovery should be available for everyone, those with substance use disorders in racially-diverse, Tribal, rural, and other underserved communities often lack access to the support services that they need to receive treatment and sustain their recovery. Research also shows that a treatment gap lingers between people of color and their white neighbors. People of color not only have less access to support services for addiction but are also subject to harsher penalties when addiction leads to interaction with the criminal justice system. To address this, my Administration launched a Government-wide approach to advancing equity, including in our public health and criminal justice approaches to drug policy.</FP>
    <FP>When we make the appropriate support and service systems available to everyone and embrace those seeking to rejoin and contribute to our communities, we put sustained recovery within reach of more people. When we welcome Americans in recovery into our schools, homes, and workplaces with open arms, our Nation becomes stronger, healthier, and more inclusive.</FP>
    <FP>
        During National Recovery Month, we also honor and thank those who have helped our Nation heal and build back better. In the face of unprecedented 
        <PRTPAGE P="179"/>
        challenges this past year, our Nation's health care providers have delivered essential care and hope to individuals, families, and communities in need. On the frontlines of the addiction epidemic, they have ensured our Nation's system of care remains intact, facilitating treatment and recovery. As always, we celebrate the resilience and courage of the recovery community, which serves as a reminder that recovery is possible for everyone.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Recovery Month.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, 100,000 Americans live with sickle cell disease (SCD). The genetic disease, named for the sickle-shaped red blood cells it causes, leads to severe pain, serious infections, and organ damage. The severity of SCD varies, with many people facing a shortened life expectancy and a host of recurring, debilitating, and expensive health problems.</FP>
    <FP>This condition also disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans, with an estimated 1 in 365 Black Americans and 1 in 14,000 Hispanic Americans suffering from it. As President, I am committed to supporting those who have been hit the hardest by SCD. And during National Sickle Cell Awareness month, our Nation reaffirms our commitment to improving the quality of life and health outcomes for all individuals living with SCD.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation's extraordinary medical professionals and scientists are working tirelessly to find a cure and develop improved treatments for SCD. Recent scientific advances have led to effective approaches for managing SCD and preventing complications, including new drug therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And while current treatments may not be universally effective, researchers continue to improve existing treatments, such as bone marrow transplants that can effectively cure SCD in some patients. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has continued supporting SCD research, education, and capacity building, including the “Cure Sickle Cell Initiative” to accelerate safe, effective, and scalable gene therapies to cure the disease. As a result of the many advances and medical breakthroughs in genetic therapies and research, we are now closer to finding a cure for all SCD patients.
        <PRTPAGE P="180"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to following science, delivering breakthroughs, eliminating health disparities facing communities of color and other underserved communities, and promoting the health and wellness of all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>We will continue our efforts to improve the lives and livelihoods of individuals struggling with SCD by improving access to quality health care, collaborating with our partners in the public and private sectors, adhering to the guidance of scientific experts and researchers, and supporting all families affected by SCD.</FP>
    <FP>This month, we celebrate the progress made in treating Americans suffering from SCD and we stand together to improve the health of those living with this disease.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about the progress we are making to reduce the burden of this disease on our fellow Americans.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Wilderness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America's public lands and waters, awe-inspiring landscapes, and cultural sites reflect a deep and abiding connection to our natural heritage. Our lands and waters are rich with diverse plant and animal life, and we are privileged to be able to enjoy irreplaceable national treasures that amaze us, inspire us, fill us with pride, support our lives and livelihoods, and belong to all of us in equal measure.</FP>
    <FP>During National Wilderness Month, we affirm that our Nation's public lands and waters must be accessible to all Americans, we recognize that our lands and waters can revitalize the soul and solidify our respect for the natural wonders that surround us and the earth we share, and we recommit to their preservation and protection, today and for future generations.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Wilderness Act, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, opened a new chapter in American conservation by creating the National Wilderness Preservation System. The primary goal of the act is to preserve the places “where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled.” Today, the National Wilderness Preservation System includes more than 800 wilderness areas spanning more than 111 million 
        <PRTPAGE P="181"/>
        acres. These wilderness areas are located within national forests, parks, wildlife refuges, and conservation lands and waters. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans turned to these areas for physical recreation, mental well-being, and inspiration, and our public lands and waters became places of healing and sanctuary.
    </FP>
    <FP>But our natural wonders are at risk. Now more than ever, we must come together to combat the climate crisis and unprecedented acceleration of species extinction, to protect and conserve our great outdoors before it is too late. Since taking office, I have recommitted the United States to the Paris Climate Agreement, pushed for stronger action to cut greenhouse gas pollution, and resolved to strengthen our resilience against rising temperatures. Additionally, my Administration's historic “America the Beautiful” initiative sets a national conservation goal to invest in, conserve, connect, and restore at least 30 percent of the Nation's lands and waters by 2030. These diverse landscapes and waterways are vital in so many ways: they provide homes to fish and wildlife, and hold resources that sustain our own lives, counteract the damaging impacts of climate change, and underpin our global economy.</FP>
    <FP>We also recognize that not all Americans have access to our public lands. My Administration is committed to ensuring that all peoples and communities have clean air and clean water, and receive the additional physical, spiritual, and economic benefits that our great wilderness provides. As the original stewards of these lands, Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities have a sacred connection and deep understanding of our Nation's wilderness areas, and the history of America's public lands has too often involved broken promises to the Native peoples who have lived on them since time immemorial. I am committed to working in partnership with Tribal, State, and local partners to find solutions to our most pressing conservation and stewardship challenges, and to honoring the special relationship of Tribes to their ancestral sacred lands. This work is urgent.</FP>
    <FP>During National Wilderness Month, let us strengthen our connection to the American wilderness areas, support their designation and protection, and work to preserve the stories they tell, the memories they create, and the heritage they reflect for all Americans for generations to come.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2021 as National Wilderness Month. I encourage all Americans to experience our Nation's outdoor heritage, to recreate responsibly and to leave no trace, to celebrate the value of preserving an enduring resource of wilderness, and to strengthen our commitment to protecting these vital lands and waters now and for future generations.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since 1837, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have educated and prepared millions of people to lift up our Nation and make their impact on the world. These essential institutions have been critical engines of opportunity for generations of American families—they are incubators of excellence, helping to shape the story of our Nation and deliver on the promise of a more perfect Union. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we celebrate the vital role that HBCUs play in molding Black leaders and ensuring that America continues to move closer to reaching its full potential.</FP>
    <FP>From Delaware State—which has always held a special place in my heart—to more than 100 institutions across the country, HBCU graduates are the bearers of a proud and sacred tradition. It is the tradition of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall, of Toni Morrison and Langston Hughes, of Reverend Jesse Jackson and Reverend William Barber. It is the tradition of countless scholars and advocates; leaders of industry, arts, and sciences; and leaders of faith and community. It is the tradition of trailblazers—including the first HBCU graduate elected to the Vice Presidency, Kamala Harris. It is a tradition rooted in a fundamental belief that quality education is a right that belongs to all people—that every single American should have a fair and equal chance to go as far as their God-given talents can take them.</FP>
    <FP>Opposition to that belief has been a stain on our Nation since its founding. After President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, Black Americans were still subjected to persistent legal and social discrimination. Laws were enacted to stifle their progress, including laws that denied Black Americans access to the same educational opportunities as white Americans. Across the generations since, progress has been won. Racial segregation of public schools was struck down by the Supreme Court in a case successfully argued by HBCU graduates. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in public accommodations and federally-funded programs. Over time, hearts and minds have been changed. For more than 180 years, HBCUs have been on the forefront of that progress.</FP>
    <FP>
        Still, the wound—and the reality—of systemic racism remains. We see it in our education system, our labor force, our health care system, our criminal justice system, and in so many other corners of our society. We see it in the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed and exacerbated longstanding disparities in areas like food security, internet access, and medical care. For Black women and girls, LGBTQ+ Black Americans, and Black Americans with disabilities—we see it compounded with other forms of discrimination and bias. As they have throughout their existence, HBCUs have risen to the occasion to serve their students and communities over the last year and a half—helping to develop breakthrough treatments, hosting life-saving COVID-19 vaccination sites, and nurturing movements for justice and equality.
        <PRTPAGE P="183"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration stands with HBCUs and is committed to the fundamental American promise they represent: that all of us are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout our lives. Too many times throughout our history, we have allowed a narrow, cramped view of that promise to fester—the false idea that America is a zero-sum game of opportunity, where a person can only lift themselves up by holding others down. It is critical that we shed that flawed way of thinking and finally embrace what we know to be true:  that when any one of us is held back, we are all held back, and when we lift each other up, we are all lifted up.</FP>
    <FP>That idea—the defining idea of America—is why I issued an Executive Order on my first day in office establishing a whole-of-government approach to equity and racial justice. It is why I have built the most diverse Cabinet in history, why I am appointing Black judges to the Federal judiciary at an historic rate, and why we are continuing to build an Administration that truly looks like America.</FP>
    <FP>It is also why we will continue to support HBCUs in their vital mission. Imagine how much more creative and innovative America would be if our HBCUs had the same funding and resources as other institutions—allowing young people from every community to compete for the jobs and industries of the future. To help make that a reality, my Administration has proposed approximately $239 million in new institutional aid funding for HBCUs in the Department of Education budget for next year, including $72 million in new discretionary funding for HBCUs. In addition, my Administration has proposed approximately $167 million in new mandatory funding for HBCUs and to provide 2 years of subsidized tuition and expand programs in high-demand fields at HBCUs.</FP>
    <FP>I today signed an Executive Order establishing the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which will create a Government-wide approach to support the needs of HBCUs and the communities they serve and eliminate systemic barriers impeding HBCU participation in Federal programs.</FP>
    <FP>This is only the beginning of our work to support HBCUs and the remarkable students they empower and grow. This week and every week, we will continue to celebrate and advance the historic and ongoing success of our HBCUs—because we know that their success is America's success.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 5 through September 11, 2021, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.

    <EAR>Proc. 10250</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Labor Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>My father taught me from a young age that a job is about much more than a paycheck. It is about dignity, respect, and your place in the community. It is about being able to look your children in the eye and assure them that things are going to be okay. When Americans go to work each day, they are not just making a living—they are pursuing a life with hope for the future. In doing so, they build, drive, care for, and grow our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Hard-working Americans are the backbone of our country. As I have often said, the middle class built America—and unions built the middle class. Everything that supports a sustainable middle-class life was made possible by unions, and on Labor Day we honor all those workers—and their enduring movement—that keep our economy moving and make our Nation strong.</FP>
    <FP>I believe that every worker deserves not only a fair wage and benefits—but freedom from discrimination, a safe and healthy workplace, and the respect that comes with a secure retirement as well. That is why my Administration always stands proudly with workers. It is why, in the American Rescue Plan, we gave working people a break—helping workers weather the pandemic, giving middle-class families raising children a historic tax cut, and upholding the promise of a dignified retirement by protecting the hard-earned pensions of millions of American workers and retirees. It is also why I am committed to ensuring that all workers have a free and fair opportunity to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers. This has been a guiding principle of our Nation since union organizing was explicitly encouraged by the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. But for far too long, that principle has been attacked and neglected.</FP>
    <FP>American workers should make their own decisions—free from coercion and intimidation—about organizing with their co-workers to have a stronger voice in their workplaces, their communities, and their government. That is why I strongly support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. It is also why I created the Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, and asked Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Labor Martin Walsh to serve as its chair and vice chair.</FP>
    <FP>
        After more than a year in which essential workers made extraordinary sacrifices and carried our Nation on their backs, this Labor Day we see more clearly than ever that we must build an economy that responds to the needs and aspirations of working people—an economy that deals everyone in and brings everyone along. The pandemic has also exacerbated and revealed for all to see the places where our Nation has fallen short of its promise to deliver equal opportunity to workers of color and their communities. To help address that long-standing challenge, my Administration is pursuing a comprehensive approach to advancing equity, as illustrated in the Executive Order I signed on my first day in office entitled Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities.
        <PRTPAGE P="185"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Despite the tremendous progress we have made to advance labor protections and strengthen the voice of workers in the workplace, there is still much more we need to do. As in every generation since Labor Day was first celebrated in the late 19th century, there are still those who resist Americans' efforts to build and sustain worker power—the engine of our economic growth, the key to our long-term success, and the best defense against corporate abuses of power in workplaces, our economy, and our democracy. Over the years, the Labor Movement has won many battles:  establishing the 40-hour work week, integrating workplaces, eliminating child labor, securing health and safety protections for workers, and countless other victories. Workers and their unions prevailed time and time again—but the work continues. We are going to keep fighting to restore power to working families and protect the rights of hard-working Americans and unions. That includes seizing the golden opportunity ahead of us to make the largest investment in nearly a century in American infrastructure, American workers, and good union jobs through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</FP>
    <FP>On this Labor Day, we honor the pioneers who stood up for the dignity of working people—leaders like César Chávez, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Phillip Randolph, John L. Lewis, Samuel Gompers, Frances Perkins, and many more. Let us also remember the tireless voices for working families that we have recently lost, including my friend Richard Trumka. We must recommit ourselves to advancing the historic progress these trailblazers made as we work to deliver a decent life with security, respect, and dignity for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 6, 2021, as Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the energy and innovation of working Americans.</FP>

        Twenty years ago, our Nation was forever changed. On September 11, 2001, as ordinary people started their days in Manhattan, Shanksville, and Arlington, cowardly acts born out of twisted hate stole 2,977 innocent lives, devastating families and communities. People across the world were shocked by the cruelty and horror of the terrorist act, even as they were inspired by the bravery of the first responders. Two decades have passed 
        <PRTPAGE P="186"/>
        since that day of terror, yet the trauma, the pain, and the quest for justice—both personal and collective—still haunt our memories. Planes piercing buildings. Smoke filling skies. Towers turning to dust. The injured fleeing to safety. The heroes rushing toward danger.
    </FP>
    <FP>During the National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we honor those who lost their lives on September 11—lives that will never be forgotten. We also commemorate the humanity and selfless sacrifice of the first responders, service members, and ordinary citizens who banded together to rescue survivors and build a community of support around those who suffered unimaginable loss. Even as we continue to recover from this tragedy, we know for certain that there is nothing that America cannot overcome. Through sorrow, with God's help, we find strength. Through remembrance, in God's mercy, we find healing. We move forward with resolve, forever cherishing the memories of the souls who perished that day.</FP>
    <FP>The seeds of chaos, planted that September by those who wished to harm us, blossomed instead into fields of hope for a brighter future. A new generation of patriots—many of whom were just children on that bright September morning, some of whom had not yet been born—now serve in our Armed Forces, as law enforcement officers and firefighters, as paramedics, in the halls of our Federal buildings, and beyond, determined to build our country back better, safer, and more united.</FP>
    <FP>During these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we solemnly reflect on the freedom and tolerance that are part of our American character. We commit to preserving the memories of our fallen loved ones with the same tenacity with which we uphold the American values that are the root of our strength.

I ask that people of the United States honor and remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other appropriate ceremonies and activities.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">World Suicide Prevention Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, the United States joins the World Health Organization, the International Association for Suicide Prevention, and nations around the world in commemorating World Suicide Prevention Day by “creating hope through action.” On this day, and every day, we remember those lives lost to suicide. We also commit to connecting with those who are struggling and to encouraging communities, organizations, and governments to work together to prevent suicide.</FP>
    <FP>Suicide often occurs in a moment of unbearable pain or deep despair. Many individuals with mental health needs are overcome with a sense of overwhelming hopelessness, and feel they have nowhere to turn.</FP>
    <FP>Already, millions of Americans consider suicide, make a suicide plan, or attempt suicide every year—especially young Americans for whom suicide is the second leading cause of death. This number is even higher among LGBTQ+ and Native American youth.</FP>
    <FP>In 2019, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 10 and 34. And that was before the COVID-19 pandemic compounded, for many, feelings of isolation, exhaustion, and economic and public health-related anxieties. Increased rates of depression have sparked concern that we will see a further increase in suicide rates.</FP>
    <FP>Too many of our Nation's veterans and active military service members have also considered suicide or taken their own lives. In many cases, they did not receive the mental health services they need and deserve. In order to fulfill our Nation's one sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, I have made veteran suicide prevention a top priority. Earlier this year, I was proud to sign the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act of 2021 into law to provide additional mental health care for rural veterans. In my budget, I also requested $598 million to support the Department of Veterans Affairs suicide prevention outreach efforts.</FP>
    <FP>I have proposed $180 million to fund suicide prevention programs at the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This dedicated funding will support programming that focuses on suicide prevention at every age and stage of a person's life, as well as prevention and intervention programs through health systems. Knowing that our Nation's youth have been especially vulnerable to the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Rescue Plan I signed into law also includes $20 million in funding specifically for youth suicide prevention.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is committed to treating suicide as the public health problem it is and helping to address the underlying risk factors for suicide. For example, we are working to expand access to mental health and substance use treatment. We are ensuring health insurance plans act in accordance with the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and 
        <PRTPAGE P="188"/>
        Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and cover these critical services at the same level as physical health services.
    </FP>
    <FP>While there is no one cause of suicide, we know there are many factors that increase a person's risk for suicide, including the loss of a job; serious illness; and financial, criminal, legal, and relationship problems.</FP>
    <FP>Through the American Rescue Plan and my proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget, we are working to mitigate these risk factors. The American Rescue Plan provided a third round of economic impact payments, established a homeowner assistance fund, and provided emergency rental assistance.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also committed to addressing suicide by firearm. Firearms are responsible for over half of all suicide deaths in the United States. That is one of the reasons we have published model red flag laws for States—allowing family members and law enforcement to petition for a temporary firearms ban for individuals who present a danger to themselves or others. When people present a danger to themselves or others, we must reduce their access to lethal means and ensure they have access to mental health services and supports.</FP>
    <FP>If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, please know that you are not alone and help is available 24/7 by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK or through the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. Next July, the new Mental Health Crisis Line 9-8-8 will take effect. By expanding the crisis line and investing in our Nation's crisis care infrastructure, we have the opportunity to prevent suicides and save lives.</FP>
    <FP>Today, on World Suicide Prevention Day, we remember those whom we lost to suicide, and we reconfirm our support for the millions of Americans who struggle with thoughts of suicide, who are suicide attempt survivors, suicide loss survivors, and those who are working steadfastly to prevent suicide.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10, 2021, as World Suicide Prevention Day. I call upon all Americans, communities, organizations, and all levels of government to join me in creating hope through action and committing to preventing suicide across America.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Small Business Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The American entrepreneurial spirit is a defining quality of our Nation which time and again has lifted us to new heights and carried us through our greatest challenges. Small businesses are not only the engines of our economic progress—they are the heart and soul of our communities. During National Small Business Week, we celebrate our Nation's small businesses—the pillars of their neighborhoods and towns—and all of the people who dream them, build them, and make them run.</FP>
    <FP>When the COVID-19 pandemic first struck last year, it posed a historic challenge to America's small businesses. From coast to coast, in big cities, small towns, rural enclaves, and Tribal communities, small business owners and workers demonstrated remarkable courage and resilience, adapting to sudden changes in our way of life and stepping up to serve their communities. Across the country, small businesses extended helping hands to their neighbors during the pandemic's darkest hours, all while entrepreneurs and employees worked tirelessly around the clock to keep their businesses afloat, make payroll, and ensure the safety of their teams and customers.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the determination of our Nation's small business owners and their employees, the pandemic hit them hard. Throughout 2020, empty storefronts and goodbye signs hanging in windows could be found on Main Streets across the country. The pizza place that your kids loved best. The hardware store that always had the tool you needed. The barber shop that sponsored the local Little League team—and had the first dollar bill it ever earned still framed on the wall. The pandemic exacted an incalculable toll not only on lives and livelihoods, but on far too many small business dreams and family legacies.</FP>
    <FP>
        To ensure that these community pillars have a fighting chance to reopen and stay open, my Administration is delivering the loans and support that our Nation's more than 30 million small businesses and innovative startups need. The American Rescue Plan delivered billions of dollars in economic relief to millions of small businesses—including programs targeted to the hardest-hit industries such as restaurants and performing arts venues. We revamped the Paycheck Protection Program to reach our smallest businesses, with more than 95 percent of the nearly $300 billion in loans made during my Administration supporting small businesses with less than 20 employees, reaching a higher share of businesses in rural and low- or moderate-income communities than in the previous two rounds of the program. Through our Restaurant Revitalization Fund, we provided an essential lifeline to more than 100,000 businesses across the country, delivering $28.6 billion in direct support. Last week, my Administration began accepting applications for an improved COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, which will put more than $150 billion in funding to work offering long-term, low-interest loans that small businesses can use to retain workers, make rent, and pay down more expensive debt. In the American Rescue Plan, we established the Community Navigator Pilot program to create 
        <PRTPAGE P="190"/>
        a network of trusted organizations, local governments, and community champions to help underserved small businesses navigate resources at all stages of their growth.
    </FP>
    <FP>We have also fully vaccinated more than 64 percent of adult Americans, so that more small businesses can reopen their doors and welcome back their customers. My Administration created a tax credit to help small businesses—which employ nearly half of America's private workforce—give their employees paid time off to get vaccinated and recover.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also committed to nurturing small businesses that have faced historic barriers in rural and urban America, including businesses owned by veterans, women, and people of color—especially Black, Latino, and Asian American businesses. These entrepreneurs continue to face persistent barriers to the capital, markets, and networks they need to start and grow their businesses, and many were left out of early rounds of relief in the earlier days of the pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>To help ensure that small businesses in every community benefit from the Build Back Better agenda's landmark investments in our infrastructure, we are strengthening our contracting programs for underserved small businesses. As part of this effort, I announced a Government-wide goal to grow Federal contracting with small, disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent, translating into an additional $100 billion over 5 years. By ensuring that more disadvantaged small businesses can compete for and win Federal contracts, we can boost job opportunities and economic prosperity in every corner of America.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation's small businesses define our communities, drive innovation, and create the products and services that enrich our lives and solve global problems to build a better and more sustainable world. By harnessing the power of our small business economy and equipping our entrepreneurs with the tools and resources they need to innovate, adapt, and grow, our economy will continue to build back better than ever before. America's small businesses are up to the task.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 to September 18 as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the American economy, continue supporting them, and honor the occasion with programs and activities that highlight these important businesses.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Twenty years ago, the United States endured one of the most unconscionable tragedies in our country's history. The cowardly terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and onboard United Flight 93 cut short the lives of 2,977 innocent people. These attacks tore a hole in the heart of our Nation, and the pain of this tragedy still remains. Each year on this somber date, we remember the horror and bravery shown that day, just as we remember how we came together, united in grief and in purpose. Each year, we renew our solemn vow to never forget what happened on September 11, 2001, or those who lost their lives.</FP>
    <FP>On Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, we honor every life that was taken too soon. We honor the first responders—firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency workers, and service members—who answered the call of duty, and the brave civilians who rushed into action to save lives that day. Their courage embodies the American spirit and resilience, and their heroism continues to inspire new generations of Americans.</FP>
    <FP>My mother used to say that “courage lies in every heart, and one day it will be summoned.” It was summoned and shown by those who responded to the events on 9/11. First responders, emergency workers, and civilians ran to where the devastation was the greatest, where death came in an instant but where there were survivors to be found; a determined group of heroes onboard United Flight 93 sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others—in every case, Americans faced the unimaginable with resolve and courage. Today and every day, we draw hope from the strength and selflessness of those who stepped up to serve their fellow man and our Nation on that tragic day.</FP>
    <FP>We also remember the patriotism and valor of our service members who pursued our attackers, delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and degraded al-Qa'ida. We will keep our sacred obligation to care for our service members and veterans who served in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.</FP>
    <FP>Over the last two decades the American people have demonstrated that the harder the circumstances, the more resilient and stronger we become. Our shared love of country and our shared values—regardless of race, gender, religion, origin, or economic status—unite us as Americans against all enemies, foreign and domestic.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, on this Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, we move forward as one Nation, united by our common goal of liberty and justice for all. We remember those killed on September 11, 2001, and honor them through acts of service. I encourage all Americans to visit americorps.gov/911-day to learn about and seek opportunities to serve others on this day and to demonstrate once again that the ideals we hold, 
        <PRTPAGE P="192"/>
        which many have tried to attack and destroy, are the very bonds that hold us together—even tighter in times of peril.
    </FP>
    <FP>By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as “Patriot Day,” and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized “National Day of Service and Remembrance.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2021, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Grandparents Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On National Grandparents Day, we celebrate the important role grandparents play in providing love, wisdom, and strength to their families, and fostering greater understanding across generations. Grandmas and grandpas, abuelas y abuelos, nanas and pop-pops—through their wisdom, their perseverance, and their unconditional love—strengthen our family bonds. They share with us who we are, where we come from, and the experiences that have shaped their lives, and, in many cases, shaped our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>For Jill and me, there is no greater joy than spending time with our own grandchildren. They are the love of our lives, and the life of our love.</FP>
    <FP>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly devastating to seniors, and too many families have lost grandparents to the virus. We mourn them as a Nation. To honor the memory of those we have lost and protect those most vulnerable, we mobilized an historic vaccination effort. Already, we have fully vaccinated over 82 percent of all seniors and over 64 percent 
        <PRTPAGE P="193"/>
        of all adults—allowing grandparents and their loved ones to get back together safely.
    </FP>
    <FP>During the worst of COVID-19, we saw the bonds of love that grandparents share with their families remain strong. While the virus denied many grandparents the opportunity to hug their grandchildren, we saw families visiting grandparents outside a window, waving from a safe distance, participating in car parades, or making video calls to stay connected. Grandparents and grandchildren were resilient and creative—sharing recitals, sporting events, graduations, and other important family milestones remotely. Physically apart, we remained bonded by love, faith, and the uniquely American spirit. As we continue our fight against the virus, we are once again able to enjoy the in person warmth and care of our grandparents, and they can enjoy precious time with their children and grandchildren.</FP>
    <FP>For many families, grandparents are the caregivers who provide trusted support to parents and children alike. They care for grandchildren while their parents are at work, pick up grandchildren from school and activities, and provide advice and comfort when needed most. In increasing numbers, grandparents have become primary caregivers when parents cannot care for their children. They sacrifice their own retirement plans, and often strain their own health and financial stability, to ensure their grandchildren continue to grow and learn within the warm embrace of a loving family.</FP>
    <FP>In 2018, the Congress enacted the Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act, which established an Advisory Council to Support Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. By the end of this year, the Council will release their first report to the Congress, including recommendations intended to advance change and improve support programs for grandparent and kinship families of all ages.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration looks forward to the release of this report so that we can use it as a guide to improve the livelihoods of grandparents and other older relative caregivers. As President, I am committed to identifying unmet needs, highlighting systemic gaps, and providing recommendations on how we can work together to improve the lives of grandparents and the children they support.</FP>
    <FP>Thanks to our whole-of-government response, heroic frontline workers, world-class scientists, and millions of Americans getting vaccinated, many of us are able to hug our grandparents, and gather around a table once again. We still have more work to do, but we have learned to never take time together for granted. If everyone does their part in getting vaccinated—we will continue to create new, joyful memories. We are grateful for the blessing of that opportunity, and we hope every family will cherish their grandparents today and every day.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12, 2021, as National Grandparents Day.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Today, more than a quarter of American schoolchildren are Hispanic—and the proportion of Hispanic Americans in our workforce is projected to grow substantially over the next 10 years. The educational success of Hispanic Americans is vital to the future of our entire country; how we as a Nation nurture that success will define our strength and stability, our shared prosperity, and our competitiveness on the world stage for generations to come.</FP>
    <FP>For decades, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) have played a key role in preparing Hispanic American scholars, artists, researchers, scientists, educators, and other leaders who make our communities and our Nation stronger, more resilient, and more equitable. HSIs advance the foundational American ideals of equity and justice by preparing graduates to contribute their God-given talents and help solve some of the greatest challenges facing our Nation and our world.</FP>
    <FP>To do this, HSIs are on the cutting edge, equipping students with the knowledge and skills they need to compete in the 21st century economy and carve out their place in the middle class. In industry after industry, HSIs empower the next generation of Hispanic American leaders—while also celebrating and nourishing the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds that make up the broader Hispanic community.</FP>
    <FP>This work is essential to both the character and the economy of our Nation. Over the last 18 months, Hispanic Americans in every community have helped carry us through the COVID-19 pandemic and spark an historic economic recovery—as doctors and nurses, teachers and first responders, essential workers who keep our country going, and in countless other roles. Hispanic Americans are core to our national fabric, and HSIs are a critical resource in empowering and enriching Hispanic students and our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Beyond academic and professional preparation, HSIs also positively impact their communities. I am especially grateful for the leadership of HSIs in safeguarding the rights and dignity of Dreamers and first-generation college students across our Nation. It is my fervent hope that the Congress will provide security to all Dreamers. These young people represent America's strength—and our greatest aspirations. We cannot let them down.</FP>
    <FP>
        Since I took office, my Administration has worked to support the health, education, equity, and economic well-being of Hispanic Americans. In my first week as President, I signed an Executive Order establishing a whole-of-government approach to advancing equity and racial justice. Additionally, my Administration moved swiftly to provide COVID relief to HSIs, families, and small businesses through the American Rescue Plan—a law 
        <PRTPAGE P="195"/>
        which on its own is projected to cut Hispanic poverty in America this year by 43 percent. We have also reestablished the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am proud of the historic investments that my Administration has made to lift up Hispanic Americans—and we will continue to fight for the rights, dignity, and success of Hispanic Americans every day.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through September 18, 2021, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize that Hispanic heritage is American heritage. We see it in every aspect of our national life: on our television and movie screens, in the music that moves our feet, and in the foods we enjoy. We benefit from the many contributions of Hispanic scientists working in labs across the country to help us fight COVID-19 and the doctors and the nurses on the front lines caring for people's health. Our Nation is represented by Hispanic diplomats who share our values in countries all over the world and strengthened by military members and their families who serve and sacrifice for the United States. Our communities are represented by Hispanic elected officials, and our children are taught by Hispanic teachers. Our future will be shaped by Hispanic engineers who are working to develop new technology that will help us grasp our clean energy future and by the skilled union workers who are going to build it.</FP>
    <FP>
        National Hispanic Heritage Month is an important reminder of how much strength we draw as a Nation from our immigrant roots and our values as a Nation of immigrants. I am proud to recognize my four Hispanic Cabinet Secretaries—Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona and Small Business Administrator Isabel Guzman—who are all leading executive departments that oversee critical components of American life. My Administration is focused on making equity a priority 
        <PRTPAGE P="196"/>
        and ensuring that Hispanics are front and center in our efforts to improve the lives of working families across the country.
    </FP>
    <FP>During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we also recognize that America cannot succeed unless Hispanic families and communities succeed, sharing equally in the benefits of our recovery and our investments. My American Rescue Plan provided much-needed relief to the Hispanic community during the pandemic. Additional Paycheck Protection Program funding for small businesses and rental assistance has helped families stay in their homes, and the child tax credit is helping lift Hispanic children out of poverty.</FP>
    <FP>A critical key to building back better is ensuring that Hispanic communities also benefit from investments in roads, clean water, and broadband as well as access to early education and other resources that support working families and improve educational outcomes. We must also continue the fight to protect the sacred right to vote and provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented Hispanics—especially Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status holders, farmworkers, and essential workers—through desperately needed immigration reform. Creating a pathway to citizenship is a top priority for my Administration not only because this benefits our Nation's economy but also because it is the right thing to do.</FP>
    <FP>As we honor and celebrate the contributions of Hispanics to our Nation, we also reaffirm our commitment to extending the hand of friendship to Latin America and strengthening democracy in the region. My Administration has sent over 5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to Mexico with millions more on the way. We have donated over 33 million doses of the vaccine to 21 other countries in Latin America. This included the first doses of the vaccine to reach Haiti, carried there by the United States Coast Guard. This vaccine will help protect Haiti's first responders and health care workers.</FP>
    <FP>In recognition of the achievements of Hispanics, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as “National Hispanic Heritage Month.”</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For 234 years, America's Constitution has guided our growth, shaped our progress, and defined us as a Nation of sacred laws and fundamental values. When our democracy is tested, we draw strength from the Constitution to see us through. When we look ahead in our uniquely American way—restless, bold, and optimistic—our Constitution is the bedrock we build upon to make our Nation more equal, more just, and more prosperous for all our people.</FP>
    <FP>American democracy requires our constant care, vigilance, and full participation to determine the course and conscience of our Union. As President, I swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that we uphold and strengthen this remarkable system of self-government for future generations ready to put their own shoulders to the wheel.</FP>
    <FP>The Framers of the Constitution understood the extraordinary promise of a democratic system of government—a Nation that could be made a “more perfect Union” by each passing generation to come. They laid out a set of basic principles and equipped the American people with all that was necessary to meet the changing needs and values of our country through the years.</FP>
    <FP>For more than two centuries, women and men have struggled and strived to make good on the promise of our founding document and to expand the promise of America by amending our Constitution in accordance with our growth and progress as a Nation—just as the Framers envisioned they would. Through Civil War, the fight for universal suffrage, and the heroic non-violent resistance of the Civil Rights Movement—from Seneca Falls to Selma and countless acts of civic bravery beyond—courageous Americans have fought, sacrificed, and changed hearts and minds to deliver the full breadth of human dignity to which our Constitution aspires. Fully realizing these ideals and attaining justice for all remains an urgent and enduring imperative.</FP>
    <FP>Today, we are in the midst of grave attempts to suppress and subvert the right to vote in free and fair elections—the most sacred right in our democracy and the very heart of our Constitution. We must continue to rebuff these threats to ensure that American democracy remains healthy and strong. My Administration is pursuing an all-of-government effort to protect and expand the fundamental right to vote and make our democracy more equitable and accessible for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>
        I have often said that America is the only Nation founded on an idea. Though we have never fully lived up to it, we have never walked away from it. We have never stopped striving to fulfill the founding promise of our Nation—that all of us are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. My Administration is committed to bringing us closer to the fulfillment of that promise.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>When service members take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, they do so knowing that they may be called upon to make great sacrifices to ensure and sustain our shared values. These patriots accept those risks and rush to fulfill the mission, no matter how harsh or dangerous the conditions. They embody the best of the American spirit. For the families and friends who wait at home, anxious for news of their loved ones, these sacrifices can cause great pain. For the families of the more than 81,600 service members who remain missing in action—the pain and grief is compounded by a lack of closure, and the hope that their sons and daughters, sisters and brothers, parents, and grandparents will one day return home.</FP>
    <FP>On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we remember the debt we owe to them and to their families. We pay tribute to our former prisoners of war and recommit to the difficult but essential task of seeking out answers for the families of those still missing. We will always remember and honor our Nation's prisoners of war and those still missing in action, and keep faith with our promise as a Nation to bring all of our heroes home.</FP>
    <FP>
        Every day, the iconic black and white flag—a powerful symbol in recognition of the heroism and sacrifice of American POWs and MIAs—is flown above the White House. It is a mark of reverence and of solidarity with all those who await answers. Each day, this flag flies over memorials and 
        <PRTPAGE P="199"/>
        cemeteries, on military installations, at local post offices, and on the front lawns of homes across the Nation. This flag remains a symbol of America's commitment to honor the sacrifices of all those who serve.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to recovering and identifying Americans missing from prior conflicts. Our efforts are global, and we are thankful for the continued cooperation of all partner nations who advance these humanitarian efforts on behalf of American families. Loss and grief are hard enough without the added and too often prolonged pain of uncertainty. But this much is certain: the United States will never abandon the search for our service members missing and unaccounted for in overseas wars. They will never be forgotten.</FP>
    <FP>During National POW/MIA Recognition Day, our Nation conveys eternal gratitude to those who endured enemy captivity and those who made the supreme sacrifice and have yet to return home. We will stand with these heroes, who gave their all to protect and preserve our freedoms, and their families, who have kept the faith and longingly pursued answers across these many decades.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2021, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. Along with my fellow Americans, I salute our former POWs who overcame unspeakable indignities to return home with honor. For those who made the ultimate sacrifice and never came home, America will work tirelessly to provide their families and our Nation the fullest possible measure of accounting. I urge all Americans to observe this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        For many families, a business is more than a job—it is the fulfillment of a dream: a better life, a family legacy, a place in the community. Minority businesses in particular are the heart and soul of so many communities across our Nation. From Wall Street to Main Street, over 9.2 million minority business enterprises (MBEs) support jobs and generate more than $1.8 trillion for our economy every year. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, our Nation recognizes the importance of minority-owned businesses and the impact they have on every community.
        <PRTPAGE P="200"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Even as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to test America's businesses like few events in our Nation's history, MBEs and minority business owners have shown remarkable resilience, working around the clock and adapting to changes to keep their businesses running and their employees safely working. Despite these efforts, minority-owned businesses have been disproportionately hard-hit, with many forced to shut down because of revenue losses and many more hanging on by a thread.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to supporting minority entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order directing the entire Federal Government to advance equity for underserved communities across our Nation, specifically with respect to Federal procurement. In order to help our struggling businesses during the darkest moments of the pandemic, my Administration revamped the Paycheck Protection Program to provide greater access to small businesses, including minority-owned businesses.</FP>
    <FP>Because the Federal Government is the Nation's largest buyer, purchasing $600 billion of goods and services each year, and because these purchases not only meet our Nation's needs but also supply economic opportunity, I recently announced a new goal to increase the share of contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent over the next 5 years. Additionally, my Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will expand the authority and stature of the Minority Business Development Agency within the Department of Commerce so that it can continue to break barriers, blaze new trails, and eliminate the unique challenges minority-owned businesses face in accessing capital, contracts, and market avenues to success.</FP>
    <FP>During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize that our Nation and our economy are stronger because of the hardworking men and women who comprise America's minority business community. They consistently demonstrate the courage it takes to overcome adversity, seize opportunity, and contribute to our shared prosperity.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19, 2021, through September 25, 2021, as Minority Enterprise Development Week.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In every generation, America's farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers have fed and fueled our Nation, nurturing the strength and health of our people, our communities, and our economy. Since 1944, we have celebrated these critical workers during National Farm Safety and Health Week—a time for all of us to recommit ourselves to advancing the safety and well-being of all hardworking farm and ranch workers.</FP>
    <FP>The contributions of farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers have always been essential, but they have perhaps never been more evident than during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has taken an incalculable toll on our Nation's farms and farming communities, with high rates of infections and illnesses affecting nearly every facet of our agricultural system. Beyond the unique challenges posed by the pandemic, the agriculture sector has always been both physically and mentally demanding, and it remains one of the most dangerous industries in America.</FP>
    <FP>Despite these challenges, our dedicated farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers have continued to work around the clock, putting their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the line to ensure that families across the country have food on the table. Their sacrifices are commendable, but they should not have to risk injury, illness, or death to do their jobs. Our Nation has a duty to protect agricultural workers and promote safety education for farmers and farm families. We must continue to reduce the risks of accidents, injuries, and fatalities—including those on rural roadways involving tractors and other machinery—as well as the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to fertilizers and chemical agents. We must continue to get Americans vaccinated, so that our brave farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers can go to work free from the deadly threat of COVID-19.</FP>
    <FP>American farmworkers are the best in the world, and they have always faced the challenges of the job head-on. Their success is our Nation's success, and we must support them and their well-being as they feed the world, lift up their local communities, and contribute to the prosperity and possibilities of rural America and beyond. My Administration is committed to ensuring that every farmer, rancher, and farmworker can work in a safe and healthy environment. By having their backs, our Nation will continue to lead the world in agricultural production and innovation and ensure that our food supply is secure and our economy is strong.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through September 25, 2021, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon the people of the United States, including America's farmers and ranchers and agriculture-related institutions, organizations, and businesses to reaffirm a dedication to farm safety and health. I also urge all Americans to honor the historic and ongoing contributions of our agricultural sector and express appreciation and gratitude to our farmers and ranchers for their vital contributions and tireless service to our Nation.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate the time-honored traditions of hunting and fishing and their role in providing people of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to enjoy the great American outdoors. From the earliest days of our Nation, hunting and fishing have instilled respect for our long-cherished natural resources and American ethic of conservation. Passed on through generations, these beloved pastimes bring families, friends, and neighbors together to bond in the spirit of sportsmanship, cultivate respect for our lands, waters, and wildlife, and provide peaceful sanctuary amid our Nation's natural wonders.</FP>
    <FP>During the COVID-19 pandemic, hunting and fishing have been especially critical in providing a recreational reprieve for many Americans from the stressors of these difficult times. When entertainment venues, stadiums, gyms, and local businesses were closed, hunting and fishing afforded many Americans the opportunity to commune with nature and find some semblance of normalcy. The majestic public lands and waters of our country—and our responsibility to serve as good stewards of the natural resources we have been blessed with—are even more appreciated by those who took to the great outdoors as an outlet during the pandemic. It is one of the reasons the Department of the Interior recently announced the largest expansion of hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation opportunities on public lands in recent history.</FP>
    <FP>Ensuring that public lands are available to every American for activities like hunting and fishing is central to my Administration's “America the Beautiful” initiative—an ambitious goal to pursue a locally-led and national, voluntary effort to conserve, connect, and restore 30 percent of our lands and waters, by 2030. We will continue to carry out this program together with agricultural and forest landowners; anglers, hunters, and outdoor enthusiasts; Tribal Nations, States, and territories; local officials; and other important partners and stakeholders in order to identify conservation strategies that reflect the priorities of all communities. This initiative is only a starting point in our efforts to protect our environment and conserve our resources for future generations. We will continue to rely on America's sportswomen and men to pass on their love and respect for our lands, waters, and wildlife to our children and grandchildren.</FP>
    <FP>
        Hunting and fishing also play a large role in funding conservation efforts, for example through fishing licenses and Duck Stamps—works of art that 
        <PRTPAGE P="203"/>
        for nearly a century have helped protect habitats for birds and other wildlife. These activities also fuel economic prosperity—especially in rural communities—with more than 50 million Americans hunting and fishing every year, creating over $200 billion in economic activity and supporting over 1.5 million jobs. The continuation of these time-honored traditions will ensure that our lands and waters receive the care and funding they need to stay accessible and magnificent for all Americans. Whether fulfilling a family tradition on opening day of hunting season or a new angler catching their first trout on a restored river, we will ensure that future generations have the same opportunities to take part in these cherished pastimes.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On National Public Lands Day, we celebrate America's beautiful and majestic public lands—those irreplaceable natural treasures that belong to all of us in equal measure. Our Nation is blessed with an abundance of awe-inspiring public lands, including National Parks, Monuments, conservation areas, wildlife refuges, forests, grasslands, marine sanctuaries, lakes, and reservoirs. For Americans in every part of our Nation, these spaces are invaluable sources of recreation and education, of spiritual fulfillment and rejuvenation, and of inspiration and pride.</FP>
    <FP>
        Since 1994, National Public Lands Day has brought together hundreds of thousands of volunteers to help restore these essential places; today, it is the largest single-day public lands volunteer event in our Nation. From Shenandoah National Park to Tonto National Forest, volunteers complete service projects like building bridges and trails, restoring native ecosystems, collecting trash, and removing invasive species. These service projects also give volunteers the opportunity to learn more about our public lands and understand the environmental, economic, and health benefits our natural wonders provide. On this day, all federally managed public lands and waters will offer free admission for anyone in America who wishes to explore these shared spaces.
        <PRTPAGE P="204"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to conserving our precious public lands and waters. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order to create a Civilian Climate Corps, which will put dedicated Americans to work conserving and restoring our public lands and waters for the benefit of all our people. Through our “America the Beautiful” initiative, we are also working with State, local, and Tribal governments as well as private landowners through voluntary conservation efforts to achieve our goal of conserving 30 percent of our Nation's lands and waters by 2030. This decade-long effort will harness the best of the American spirit to protect our biodiversity, improve access to public spaces, and conserve and restore the lands, waters, and wildlife that we all depend on for generations to come.</FP>
    <FP>Our public lands have provided millions of Americans with a much-needed reprieve from the stress and hardships felt during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to get America vaccinated and defeat the pandemic, I invite all Americans to recognize the enormous value—both tangible and intangible—of these unique natural places and to support their local public lands and waters through acts of volunteerism and service. At the same time, we also recognize that not all Americans have equal access to our public lands. My Administration is committed to improving equitable access to nature in every community and to ensuring that every American has the opportunity to enjoy these natural spaces that belong to all of us.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2021, as National Public Lands Day.

        of others. My heart aches that this year we have more Gold Star families who must mourn their heroic loved ones. Our Nation is forever indebted to those who gave their last full measure of devotion to defend our peace and security. We are devastated by their loss and inspired by their sacrifice. When we remember these fallen service members, we must also honor the people who mourn their losses. We remember them every day, and on this day, we pay special tribute to their surviving families.
    </FP>
    <FP>The families of our fallen men and women in uniform understand the true and painful price of freedom—coping with loss and unspeakable grief. And today, on Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, we recognize their enduring pain and honor their resilience. We stand with them to preserve the legacy of their fallen loved ones and pledge that their memories and their sacrifices will never be forgotten.</FP>
    <FP>Jill and I know the pride, but also the uncertainty and fear, that military families feel when their loved ones are deployed, wondering if they will return home. Whenever I deploy our troops into harm's way, I take that responsibility seriously. It is a burden that I carry every day. Every life lost in service to this country is an unspeakable tragedy, and while we as a Nation can never repay that debt, we have a sacred obligation to support those they leave behind.</FP>
    <FP>To all of our surviving families, know that our entire Nation grieves with you. Know that there are resources available and ready to support you, and know that the American people will keep our sacred obligation to you and to the memory of your loved one.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The right to vote is central to who we are as a Nation and a people—it defines us as Americans, propels us to ever-greater progress, and serves as the foundation of our liberty. Voting provides Americans with a voice in building the country we want to live in together and the country we hope to leave to our children and grandchildren. The right to vote freely and fairly, and to have our vote counted, is a sacred and fundamental part of our Nation's character. With it, anything is possible for America; without it, nothing is.</FP>
    <FP>For our democracy to work, it is up to all of us to protect the right to vote—and to exercise it. The first step that all of us can take is to make sure that we are registered to vote. Each year, National Voter Registration Day reminds us of our right and our responsibility, as individual citizens and as one Nation, to exercise the sacred right to vote and ensure that our voices are heard.</FP>
    <FP>Through great sacrifice and the courage of generations of civil rights leaders and activists, we have made strides to ensure that more Americans are able to take part in the democratic process. We have repeatedly amended the Constitution to expand voting access across our history, and landmark legislation like the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 have helped to make those constitutional promises real and meaningful for more and more of our people.</FP>
    <FP>But this work remains unfinished. Today, the right to vote is being suppressed and subverted in many parts of the country by shameful attempts to restrict Americans' access to the ballot and the rolling back of decades of voting rights progress. This assault—largely targeting Americans of color, as such assaults so often have through the darkest chapters of our history, is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty, and on who we are as Americans. As my friend, American hero Representative John Lewis, reminded us shortly before he passed, `Democracy is not a state; it is an act.' It is our shared responsibility to act as one people to secure the basic promise of American democracy.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration has taken firm and far-reaching action to expand and protect voting rights. Earlier this year, I issued an Executive Order to promote access to voting. This order established a whole-of-government effort directing Federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, especially in some of our most underserved communities. My Administration also supports Federal legislation to set basic national standards for fair registration and voting in Federal elections and to protect against racial discrimination and the subversion of the election process. Guaranteeing the right to vote and ensuring that every vote is counted has always been one of the most patriotic things we can do, and my Administration is committed to safeguarding and strengthening our democracy.
        <PRTPAGE P="207"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>As we observe National Voter Registration Day, I encourage all eligible Americans to make sure they are registered to vote—to check their registration status and ensure that their registration is accurate and up to date—and to help their neighbors, family, and friends to do the same. Visit Vote.gov for more information on how to register to vote. I also urge policymakers and citizens across the country, of all parties, to join me in defending, strengthening, and expanding this paramount constitutional right.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Our Nation is under a constant and ever-increasing threat from malicious cyber actors. Ransomware attacks have disrupted hospitals, schools, police departments, fuel pipelines, food suppliers, and small businesses—delaying essential services and putting the lives and livelihoods of Americans at risk. Any disruption, corruption, or dysfunction of our vital infrastructure can have a debilitating effect on national and economic security, public health, and our everyday safety.</FP>
    <FP>Since its inception, Cybersecurity Awareness Month has elevated the central role that cybersecurity plays in our national security and economy. This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we recommit to doing our part to secure and protect our internet-connected devices, technology, and networks from cyber threats at work, home, school, and anywhere else we connect online. I encourage all Americans to responsibly protect their sensitive data and improve their cybersecurity awareness by embracing this year's theme: “Do Your Part. Be Cyber Smart.”</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration has worked to bolster the defense of our systems and protect the Federal Government's information and communications infrastructure. Earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order to modernize and improve the security of our technology, including areas like software security, information sharing, and Federal network modernization. The Executive Order also directs the Federal Government to only acquire products that meet strong cybersecurity standards—which, by spurring technology companies to raise the bar, will ultimately improve the security of those products for all Americans.
        <PRTPAGE P="208"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The reality is that most of our Nation's critical infrastructure—from transportation lines to energy suppliers to other vital fields—is owned and operated by the private sector. Therefore, the security of our critical infrastructure depends on Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial coordination with infrastructure owners and operators to achieve greater strength and security. My Administration is working in close coordination with the private sector. Earlier this year, we began to establish strong cybersecurity goals that outline our expectations for owners and operators of America's critical infrastructure. We also launched a 100-day initiative to improve cybersecurity across the electric sector. That initiative has already resulted in more than 150 utilities that serve 90 million Americans deploying or committing to deploy cybersecurity technology—and we are now in the process of extending that initiative to gas pipelines. My Administration is also working with the international community to elevate the profile of cybersecurity as a matter of global security interest.</FP>
    <FP>We recently convened a meeting with corporate, nonprofit, and educational leaders on how to protect their industries and our infrastructure. We are working closely with the private sector to share information, strengthen cybersecurity practices, and deploy technologies that increase resilience against cyberattacks. My Administration has also launched StopRansomware.gov to provide a one-stop resource for Americans to learn how to avoid ransomware and the steps to take if their computer becomes compromised.</FP>
    <FP>During Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I ask everyone to “Do Your Part. Be Cyber Smart.” All Americans can help increase awareness on cybersecurity best practices to reduce cyber risks. Whether you are at home, school, or the office—a few simple steps can help keep you and your online data safe and secure. By limiting the amount of personal information shared online, regularly updating devices and software, and using complex passwords and multifactor authentication methods, our entire Nation will be more resilient against the constant threat of malicious cyber actors.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Through events, training, and education, I call upon the people, businesses, and institutions of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity, to take action to better protect yourselves against cyber threats, and to observe Cybersecurity Awareness Month in support of our national security and resilience.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Arts and Humanities Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>As our Nation continues to grapple with consequential crises—from combating the ongoing global pandemic and addressing cries for racial justice to tackling the existential threat that climate change poses to our planet—the arts and humanities enable us to both understand our experiences and lift our sights. During this National Arts and Humanities Month, we celebrate the power of the arts and humanities to provide solace, understanding, and healing. We recognize the ability of the arts and humanities to amplify important and diverse voices and messages. We reflect on the fact that, as we have struggled with isolation, anxiety, and the loss of loved ones, we have turned to music and dance, literature and poetry, and philosophy and history to bring us together and help us persevere through, and grapple with, our current moment.</FP>
    <FP>From our Nation's earliest days, we have recognized the arts as a foundation of our Republic. As George Washington wrote in 1781, “The arts and sciences [are] essential to the prosperity of the State and to the ornament and happiness of human life.” Today, any American—regardless of their background—can create art and turn to it for hope, acceptance, and inspiration. The arts and humanities have united us as a Nation—from the television programs we watch to the books and exhibits that inspire us—providing a sense of community when we need it most.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated our creative sectors. Before the pandemic, our Nation's arts and culture sectors were strong and vibrant—a nearly $1 trillion industry employing over 5 million Americans. But as the pandemic canceled events and closed theatres, concert halls, and performance venues, the unemployment rates for the cultural community spiked to among the highest in the Nation. Many museums, libraries, and arts venues closed their curtains and doors, some for a final time. For our Nation to fully recover and heal, we need the creative economy and our cultural sector to recover.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration recognizes the essential role the arts and humanities play in our Nation's economy, democracy, health, and vitality and is committed to supporting the arts community. That is why my American Rescue Plan added another $1.25 billion in funding for the Shuttered Venues Operators Grant through the Small Business Administration, for a total of $16.25 billion. This critical program continues to provide much-needed relief to music and arts venues. My American Rescue Plan also provided an additional $135 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and $200 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). My proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2022 also includes significant funding increases for the NEA, NEH, and IMLS. Collectively, these funds will help put people back to work and support our Nation's creators.
        <PRTPAGE P="210"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The arts can educate. To build vaccine confidence and communicate the benefits of vaccination in creative and culturally relevant ways, my Administration has partnered with artists and cultural icons to encourage Americans of all ages and from all corners of our Nation to get vaccinated. In this way, the arts can help us put an end to COVID-19. Thanks to the progress we are making with people getting vaccinated, tens of millions of Americans can go back to plays, concerts, and the movies. The arts can also heal Americans, from those who have suffered the traumas of loss or isolation during the pandemic to veterans and service members returning from war.</FP>
    <FP>The pandemic has further revealed to us deep and unacceptable inequities in health care, education, and justice. The arts and humanities reveal the depths of these inequities and help us have the conversations and address the challenges that can be difficult to confront. The arts help us express and process our hurt and outrage as well as our joy and wonder—to better understand the experiences of our neighbors. By supporting and showcasing the creativity and experiences of those that have too often been discounted, we can advance our realization of a society that prioritizes equity and empathy.</FP>
    <FP>This October, as we celebrate National Arts and Humanities Month, let us turn to the arts and humanities as a way to help America heal and grow. Let us build back better by ensuring that our cultural workers and creators are back at work and thriving. Let us ensure that everyone in America—regardless of race, geography, ability, and socioeconomic status—has equal and unrestricted access to the arts and humanities, and the opportunities they afford.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we stand with the courageous women and men who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and honor those who have lost their battle to this terrible disease. As the second most common cancer affecting women, an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over the course of their lifetime and 281,550 
        <PRTPAGE P="211"/>
        women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States in 2021. Cancer touches so many families across the country—including ours. It is up to all of us to continue fighting for a cure and to ensure that every American has access to the quality care they need.
    </FP>
    <FP>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which provides free breast and cervical cancer screenings to low-income, uninsured, and underinsured women in every State, as well as many Tribal organizations and Territories. To find information on how to get screened through this program, visit: cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/screenings.htm. Early detection is one of the most important strategies for treating breast cancer successfully, and regular screenings are the most reliable way to detect it early. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many parts of our lives, and has produced new deficits in breast cancer early detection, so there is renewed urgency to getting these recommended screenings scheduled, before a cancer has spread and becomes less treatable. I encourage everyone to maintain their scheduled screenings, doctor appointments, and treatments without delay while observing coronavirus safety measures.</FP>
    <FP>For decades, the medical community and advocates have helped our Nation make great progress in the fight against cancer. First Lady Jill Biden is proud to be a part of that movement, having founded the Biden Breast Health Initiative, which educated high school girls in Delaware about breast health and helped them spread the word to their own families. Still, our Nation has a long way to go before this disease no longer threatens American lives. I am committed to doing everything I can to bring together our cancer research community and give them the resources they need to make progress in the prevention, detection, and treatment of breast cancer. That is why I have called for the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health at the National Institutes of Health (ARPA-H) which would invest $6.5 billion to develop breakthroughs that prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other deadly diseases. My American Rescue Plan also expands access to affordable health insurance coverage, ensuring that more women are able to receive these screenings and treatments without worrying about cost.</FP>
    <FP>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has expanded coverage to millions of women who were previously uninsured and has given millions of women access to preventive services, including screening tests such as mammograms with no out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against women with pre-existing conditions, such as breast cancer. My Administration is committed to protecting and building on the ACA to ensure that more people have access to quality, affordable health care and to lifting the inequitable health burden that falls on Black women.</FP>
    <FP>
        As we observe National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we are united in our commitment to ending breast cancer and improving the lives of all those affected by this illness. We applaud the advocates, medical professionals, researchers, and caregivers who dedicate their lives to making progress toward cures. This month, we stand in solidarity with breast cancer survivors across the country and reaffirm our commitment to advancing research efforts that deliver hope to patients everywhere.

    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control breast cancer, and pay tribute to those who have lost their lives to this disease.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Clean Energy Action Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the months leading up to this year's National Clean Energy Action Month, nearly 1 in 3 Americans has seen their community struck by weather disasters. The climate crisis is here and is threatening the safety and health of Americans across our Nation and people around the world. As the country continues to face droughts, heat waves, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes, we recognize that the window to avoid catastrophic outcomes is rapidly closing. The science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction is rising. At the same time, winter storms and hurricanes have tragically reminded us of the suffering and loss of life that can occur when access to energy is cut off or disrupted. During National Clean Energy Action Month, we recognize the importance of a clean energy future and the vital role we all have to play in working to avert the climate crisis.</FP>
    <FP>Today, the energy sector accounts for more than 80 percent of United States emissions. My Administration has set ambitious and attainable goals of reducing United States greenhouse gas emissions by achieving a 100 percent clean electricity sector by 2035 and reaching net zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. The path forward is clear: we must move quickly and decisively to power America with clean energy. This will require investment and innovation and will result not only in cleaner energy but also new jobs and lower bills.</FP>
    <FP>
        That is why my Administration has been working aggressively to scale the deployment of large-scale and rooftop solar, offshore and onshore wind, and other clean energy technologies. We are committed to investing in American innovation to drive down costs and reduce our overall demand 
        <PRTPAGE P="213"/>
        for energy. We are committed to upgrading, modernizing, and expanding our power grid to include clean power and to ensuring our grid is more resilient in the face of everything from extreme weather to cyber attacks. We are also investing in emerging technologies and bolstering our domestic supply chain for batteries and other clean technologies so that our clean energy future is made in America. At the same time, we are investing in the communities that are home to coal and fossil-fuel power plants to create new good-paying job opportunities for the workers who have powered our country and economy for over a century.
    </FP>
    <FP>While the Federal Government can leverage powerful tools to help our Nation reach our climate goals, we cannot do it alone. Every American has a role to play in making smarter, more conscientious choices about how we use power within our homes, offices, schools, and places of worship. Simple actions like turning off the lights when we leave a room or upgrading our energy monitoring systems using tools like smart thermostats can help conserve energy and save money on energy bills. These small, intentional acts can add up to significant savings.</FP>
    <FP>During National Clean Energy Action Month, we also recognize that for too long, low-income communities and communities of color have borne a disproportionate burden of pollution from fossil fuels and other industries. That is why I signed an Executive Order establishing a White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council to prioritize environmental justice and ensure a whole-of-government approach to addressing current and historical environmental injustices. Our goal is to ensure that historically underserved communities also benefit from clean energy.</FP>
    <FP>Throughout National Clean Energy Action Month, we recommit to acting on the climate crisis with urgency and moving quickly toward 100 percent clean energy, so we can create a safer, healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Clean Energy Action Month. I call upon the citizens of the United States to recognize this month by working together to mitigate climate change and achieve a healthier environment for all.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>When we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 31 years ago, our Nation moved closer to fulfilling its foundational promise of liberty, justice, dignity, and equality for all. I was enormously proud to co-sponsor the ADA as a member of the United States Senate—a truly bipartisan effort that was personal to millions of families. For more than 60 million disabled Americans, the ADA is much more than just a law. It provides a vital source of opportunity and self-sufficiency, allows for increased economic participation, and serves as a powerful shield against discrimination in the workplace. National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a chance for us to celebrate workers with disabilities and recommit ourselves to dismantling barriers to access and inclusion in the workplace.</FP>
    <FP>This year, the Office of Disability Employment Policy in the Department of Labor celebrates 20 years of helping advance opportunity for workers with disabilities across the Nation. As part of its mission, the agency remains at the forefront of emerging challenges in the workplace, such as developing comprehensive resources to ensure that workers grappling with the long-term effects of COVID-19 have access to the rights and resources they are due under disability law—including flexibilities, tools, and accommodations in the workplace.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the progress our Nation has made in recent decades, people with disabilities are still too often marginalized and denied access to the American dream. Americans with disabilities—particularly women and people of color—have faced long-standing gaps in employment, advancement, and income. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these inequities, as people with disabilities have faced heightened risks—particularly the disproportionate share of people with disabilities employed in the hardest-hit industries. Our Nation will never fully recover and rebuild unless every single community—including disabled Americans—is fully included.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration remains focused on ensuring that every single American has the chance to thrive, succeed, and contribute their talents. That is why I have issued Executive Orders to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility to bolster career paths and promote economic stability for Americans with disabilities. I have proposed eliminating outdated, discriminatory provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act that allow employers to pay disabled workers less than the minimum wage. Young people with disabilities in particular must be part of an inclusive economic recovery so that they can find the fulfilling careers, apprenticeships, and futures they deserve in every industry; to that end, we must promote the technologies and tools, as well as the attitudes, that foster welcoming work environments for young Americans. Our Nation's future will be brighter and more secure when everyone is dealt into the economy we build together.</FP>
    <FP>
        All Americans should be proud that we have made substantial progress since the days before the ADA—when an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability, when a person using a wheelchair could not take 
        <PRTPAGE P="215"/>
        a bus or a train to work, and when a person with a disability could be denied service in a restaurant or grocery store. Now, 31 years later, it is the shared responsibility of all of us to tear down the barriers that remain for people with disabilities and to ensure that all Americans have the chance to find good jobs and build good lives—for themselves and for the good of our entire Nation.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to embrace the talents and skills that workers with disabilities bring to the national recovery and to promote the right to equal employment opportunity for all people.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For too long, domestic violence was considered a “family issue” and was left for families to address in private. That is why, decades ago, I created and pushed for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to be passed. Today, we recognize the important roles of the public and private sectors, non-profit organizations, communities, and individuals in helping to prevent and address domestic violence and create a culture that refuses to tolerate abuse. Domestic violence affects millions of people in the United States, causes significant harm to the physical and mental health of survivors and their families, undermines their economic stability and overall well-being, and is a stain on the conscience of our country. While significant progress has been made in reducing domestic violence and improving services and support for survivors, much work remains to be done to expand prevention efforts and provide greater access to safety and healing. During National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we come together to reaffirm our commitment to ending domestic violence and supporting survivors.</FP>
    <FP>
        Domestic violence is an abuse of power that tears apart the fabric of relationships and families and undermines the well-being of communities. One in 4 women and 1 in 10 men have experienced sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime. Homicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States for women under 
        <PRTPAGE P="216"/>
        the age of 44, and nearly half are killed by a current or former male intimate partner. During the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic violence has become a pandemic within a pandemic, with many victims facing the added pressures of increased economic insecurity, increased time in isolation with their abusers, and limited contact with their support networks. This has made it even more difficult for victims to access the lifesaving services and support they need.
    </FP>
    <FP>To strengthen our response to domestic violence and all forms of gender-based violence, my American Rescue Plan allocated an additional $450 million to increase support for domestic violence and sexual assault service providers and to further assist survivors in their short- and long-term transition away from their abusers. It also includes a historic commitment to funding culturally-specific community-based organizations to address the needs of survivors in historically marginalized communities. My Administration also allocated an additional $550 million for domestic violence shelters and supportive service providers to develop and employ COVID-19 detection and mitigation strategies and help survivors access health care during the pandemic. In the Fiscal Year 2022 budget, I proposed an historic $1 billion for grant programs administered by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women, and more than doubled investments through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. I was also proud to sign into law the Victims of Crime Act Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act, which increases resources available to help thousands of survivors of domestic violence.</FP>
    <FP>To accelerate this progress, the White House Gender Policy Council is working to develop our Nation's first ever National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence and the Council is collaborating with the Department of State and other Federal agencies to update and strengthen our Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally. My Administration is also working to prevent and improve the response to intimate partner violence in our military and pushing to strengthen VAWA. Authoring and championing VAWA remains one of my proudest legislative achievements as a Senator, and its reauthorization is long overdue. Legislation to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA, which already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, would reduce intimate partner homicides by strengthening common sense gun laws, expand protections for Native American survivors, increase access to safe housing, expand training for trauma-informed policing, and support programs centered on restorative practices. We are also committed to reauthorizing the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to strengthen efforts to address domestic violence as a public health issue and to increase support for life-saving services and prevention programs across the Nation.</FP>
    <FP>
        During National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we honor the tremendous dedication of advocates and service providers, honor the courage and resilience of survivors, and recommit ourselves to standing with them for safety, dignity, and justice. There is still much work to do, and it will take all of us to do it. We must rededicate ourselves to creating a society where domestic violence is not tolerated, where survivors are supported, and where all people have an opportunity to thrive without fear of violence or abuse.

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support efforts to educate young people about healthy relationships centered on respect; support victims and survivors in your own families and networks; and to support the efforts of victim advocates, service providers, health care providers, and the legal system, as well as the leadership of survivors, in working to end domestic violence.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Youth Justice Action Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>I have often said that America's young people are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft—they carry the possibilities of our country and the sacred promise of a democracy where every one of us is treated equally and entitled to equal justice under the law. However, far too many of our young people are effectively excluded from participating in our democracy, having been sidelined by unnecessary encounters with the justice system. They deserve a second chance.</FP>
    <FP>During National Youth Justice Action Month, I call upon States and communities to join me in seeking justice for our youth and modernizing our juvenile justice system, a system that should allow young people to build their lives and grow with freedom and dignity.</FP>
    <FP>Long-standing inequities in our society—including in our juvenile and criminal justice systems—continue to disproportionately burden people of color and people with disabilities. Nationwide, Black youth are more than four times as likely as their white peers to be held in juvenile facilities, and they come into contact with both the juvenile justice and the child welfare systems at far higher rates. Additionally, one-third of young people in juvenile justice facilities have a disability, including many with emotional distress and learning disabilities. To deliver equal justice and equal dignity to all people, it is imperative that we root out racial inequities and other forms of discrimination from these systems.</FP>
    <FP>
        Although youth arrests are at their lowest levels in decades, each arrest can create a ripple effect of heightened risks and negative consequences for young people. Once in the system, young people may face abusive treatment and dangerous conditions, including excessive use of restraint, guard-
        <PRTPAGE P="218"/>
        instigated fights, and sexual assault. Adverse environments and lack of support make it difficult for young people who enter the carceral system to lead healthy, productive lives upon exiting.
    </FP>
    <FP>To give all of our young people a chance to live up to their full potential, we need to shift our approach from a default stance of incarceration to one of prevention—a strategy that recognizes that children's developmental stages and needs are starkly different from those of adults. Addressing racial disparities in school discipline and supporting proven early intervention efforts like afterschool and mentoring programs are simple steps we can take to help all young people find a sense of purpose and contribute to their communities. Many States are making a greater effort to keep teenagers under the jurisdiction of juvenile courts, which take their developmental needs into account and are better equipped to support their rehabilitation than systems built for adults.</FP>
    <FP>In my Fiscal Year 2022 budget, I proposed an $800 million investment to more than double our current funding for juvenile justice and youth reentry programs that protect children and help young people get the services they need to get back on their feet. This includes incentives for States and communities that introduce reforms to reduce youth incarceration—including repurposing juvenile detention facilities to focus more on youth development. It also includes resources to develop research-based solutions to steer kids away from detention and toward more positive alternatives. Through grants provided by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the Department of Justice, we are giving young people access to high-quality legal representation and resources to help them better manage the consequences of their contact with the system. We will ensure that young people in the juvenile justice system receive the counsel they are entitled to and will work to address the disproportionately high enforcement directed against young people of color.</FP>
    <FP>Moreover, my Administration is working to ensure that all young people have the support they need to avoid entering the justice system in the first place. I have proposed $1 billion for a new School-Based Health Professionals grant program to help double the number of counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools. In addition, I have proposed $443 million for Full-Service Community Schools, which would provide comprehensive wrap-around services to students and their families. Programs like these help ensure that more young people grow up in supportive environments and have what they need to reach their full potential.</FP>
    <FP>It is the responsibility of all of us to support America's youth and ensure that they are in a position to thrive in every community. By shifting our focus from incarceration to prevention, we can bring about a brighter future for our young people and our country as a whole. Together, we can fulfill the promise of an America that is just and equitable for all.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Far too many families across our Nation have been impacted by addiction and the overdose epidemic. In 2020, more than 93,000 people died from an overdose—93,000 families forced to bury a piece of their souls. The impact of this crisis echoes in communities across the Nation, in the empty chairs in classrooms and around kitchen tables. During National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month, we reaffirm our commitment to helping America's youth overcome this epidemic and lead healthy, fulfilling lives.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the need to provide more resources to address substance use disorder. Substance use disorder touches families in every community, and it is essential that we invest in a broad range of services, including prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services for mental health and substance use.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration has been working to expand evidence-based prevention programs along with access to care and recovery support services. We are committed to preventing substance use among our Nation's youth—including alcohol, tobacco products, illicit drugs, and misused prescription medications—by bringing communities together to find local solutions. Through the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Drug-Free Communities Support Program helps equip community coalitions to reduce youth substance use at the local level. We must continue to encourage parents, caregivers, educators, and other members of the community to play an active role in promoting evidence-based prevention efforts that encourage healthy lifestyles, promote alternatives to substance use, and educate young people about the harms associated with substance use. We know that delaying substance use until after adolescence, when the brain has fully developed, decreases the likelihood of an individual developing a substance use disorder. We also know that smart investments in effective school-based prevention programs save lives and save our economy money in the form of averted medical costs and improved productivity.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is also committed to advancing racial equity in our approach to drug policy—implementing fairer, more effective, and more culturally resonant policies to prevent, address, and treat substance use disorder. That is why we are supporting the development of tailored tools that strengthen prevention efforts in diverse communities. These include racial equity trainings, resources on inclusion and diversity, and racial equity decision-making frameworks. Our youth-focused efforts must also account for the fact that poverty, homelessness, trauma, and other adverse childhood 
        <PRTPAGE P="220"/>
        experiences affect drug use and the overall health of our Nation's youth—especially with respect to people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by these factors. By advancing equity in every part of our society—including our education, health care, criminal justice, and housing systems—we can build a future where all Americans can lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
    </FP>
    <FP>This October, we honor all those who champion evidence-based youth substance use prevention and recommit ourselves to ensuring that all Americans have the skills, knowledge, and resources to live full and healthy lives. Substance use disorder is a disease, and I will do everything within my power to expand access to evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services as well as reduce the supply of illicit drugs to keep more Americans safe.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2021 as National Youth Substance Use Prevention Month. I call on communities, parents, caregivers, educators, employers, healthcare professionals, law enforcement officials, faith and community leaders, and all Americans to take action to promote evidence-based prevention and improve the health of our Nation.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Manufacturing Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate all that is made in America and recognize the importance of our Nation's manufacturers to every aspect of our lives. From the electronics we rely on, to the safely packaged foods we eat, to the clothing we wear, to the appliances and furniture in our homes, to the cars we drive—American manufacturing is essential to our economy. It employs over 12 million Americans directly and many more indirectly—providing high quality jobs to communities across the country and producing the highest quality goods in the world.</FP>
    <FP>
        In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, our manufacturing sector was upended—578,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in 2020. Supply chain disruptions left our Nation short of lifesaving protective equipment, ventilators, and other essential health equipment at a time when we needed it most. However, our Nation's manufacturers and manufacturing workers stepped up—refitting their operations to produce needed materials and working long hours to make sure our Nation had what we needed.
        <PRTPAGE P="221"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The pandemic brought into even sharper focus the fragility of many of our global supply chains, which were already subject to everything from accidents and extreme weather to other countries engaging in unfair trade practices. In the name of our national and economic security and in support of American-based companies, American manufacturing, and American jobs—especially union jobs—I have committed our Nation to building our own resilient supply chains. That is why, during my first days in office, I signed an Executive Order to support manufacturing, rebuild our industrial base, and strengthen our supply chains—all while creating good-paying, union jobs. My order, ensuring that our future is made in all of America by American workers, also strengthens domestic manufacturing by directing Federal agencies to buy more American-made products.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration has also called for historic investments in making our supply chains more resilient as well as investments in new and cleaner manufacturing technologies that will help us innovate and lead in manufacturing in the 21st century. The clean energy economy presents an enormous opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing, maintaining and creating good-paying, union jobs, while cleaning up the air and water in communities across the country. That's why my Administration is calling for investments to ensure that as we build everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and that they are made in the United States with clean, American-made materials. The Federal Government is a major buyer in markets for goods and services. One of the most effective ways to support and grow American companies, put more Americans to work, and to strengthen American manufacturing is to buy American. My Administration is making the biggest enforcement change to the Buy American Act in 70 years, raising the amount of domestic content required to be considered “Made in America” from 55 percent to 75 percent.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration has also invested in our Nation's communities and the manufacturing base that builds them. Through programs like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Manufacturing USA, and opportunities sponsored by the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce, we are providing resources to support and strengthen STEM education, infrastructure, technology hubs, and economic opportunities for all people in every region of our country.</FP>
    <FP>As we continue to recover from the pandemic and millions of Americans return to work, there will be good opportunities available at all levels of the manufacturing industry that will need to be filled over the next decade.</FP>
    <FP>On National Manufacturing Day, we commit to strengthening and supporting the American manufacturers and hardworking manufacturing employees of today as well as the manufacturers and workers of the future. We commit to building a future that is made in America.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1, 2021, as National Manufacturing Day. I encourage all Americans to look for ways to get involved in your community and join me in participating in National Manufacturing Day, and, most importantly, buy American.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Fire Prevention Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>During Fire Prevention Week, we honor our brave firefighters and first responders who risk their lives to protect us every day and reaffirm the importance of fire safety and preparedness. This week, I call on all Americans to educate themselves about fire prevention and safety and recommit to taking the necessary steps to prevent fires. Whether you are in your own home or camping in one of America's majestic National Parks, taking the proper precautions and safety measures can help prevent fires and save your life and the lives of your family and others while protecting our natural wonders.</FP>
    <FP>Already this year, more than 44,000 wildfires have burned nearly 5.3 million acres of our land—an area roughly the size of the State of New Jersey. These fires have destroyed homes and priceless memories. They have forced families into shelters and filled the air with smoke for hundreds of miles. Precious lives have been lost. The fires have ground local economies to a halt, swallowed up family farms, and disrupted supply chains that fuel jobs, businesses, and communities all across the country.</FP>
    <FP>These fires represent a code red for our Nation—and we know that, unless we take bold action to address climate change, they will only continue to gain in frequency and ferocity. Scientists have warned us for years that extreme weather will only get more extreme, and today we are living it in real time. Extreme weather, including wildfires, cost America $99 billion last year; unfortunately, we are poised to break that record this year.</FP>
    <FP>That is why my Administration is committed to taking on the threat of climate change and investing in America's resilience. We have proposed investing billions of dollars to strengthen our wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response. These investments will not just save lives and homes—they will also save industries and create new jobs. When I think about climate change, I always think about the millions of good-paying, union jobs we can create—but we also need to think about all of the jobs and industries we stand to lose if we fail to act boldly enough. The evidence is overwhelming that every dollar we invest in our resilience saves us six dollars down the road, when the next fire does not spread as widely and homes and businesses are spared.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our response to this threat starts with our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line every day. To better support the wildland firefighters who serve our Nation so courageously, my Administration is committed to making sure that we have enough firefighters on call who are trained, equipped, and ready to respond. That is why I took action this summer to 
        <PRTPAGE P="223"/>
        ensure that all of our Federal firefighters will earn a minimum of $15 an hour. My Administration has increased wildland firefighter pay through bonuses and retention pay, extended seasonal firefighter employment to ensure robust response throughout the fire season, deployed new fire detection and air monitoring technologies, invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the supply of equipment, and brought additional aircraft and personnel to bear from both the Department of Defense and our partner nations.
    </FP>
    <FP>During Fire Prevention Week, I call on all Americans to educate themselves about fire safety, take the appropriate precautions when encountering fires, and honor our courageous firefighters, volunteers, and first responders. I also encourage everyone to install and maintain smoke alarms in their homes—critical elements of fire safety that have helped significantly decrease United States home fire death rates over the past 40 years. By testing alarms every month and replacing them every 10 years, we can be better prepared to respond quickly to fires and prevent tragic loss of life.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through October 9, 2021, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 3, 2021, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Community Policing Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Community policing—the practice of law enforcement professionals working side-by-side with members of their communities to keep neighborhoods safe—is a critical and proven tool used by law enforcement agencies across our Nation to improve public safety and forge strong, valuable relationships. During National Community Policing Week, we recommit to building bonds of trust between our law enforcement officers and the communities they serve and encourage community policing practices across our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>
        America's law enforcement officers play an essential role in protecting our communities and enforcing our laws. Every time an officer pins on their badge and walks out their front door, the loved ones they wave goodbye to are forced to wonder if they will return home safely. This week and 
        <PRTPAGE P="224"/>
        every week, we recognize the bravery and dedication of our peace officers who put themselves on the line each and every day to protect and serve their communities.
    </FP>
    <FP>We also recognize the role that all community members play in advancing public safety. As our country continues to reckon with a long and painful history of systemic racism—as well as the ongoing challenges of social and economic injustice, the COVID-19 pandemic, mental illness, homelessness, and substance abuse—we must think broadly, conscientiously, and creatively about the future of effective policing and how to foster strong police-community partnerships. Evidence and experience tell us that strong neighborhood relationships, the use of problem-solving to address crime systematically, and improvements to policy and training—key tenets of community policing—are all tools that help make our communities safer. My Administration is using programs such as the Department of Justice's Project Safe Neighborhoods to bring together law enforcement and community stakeholders in an effort to develop local solutions to help prevent violent crime.</FP>
    <FP>I have long been an advocate for community policing, just as my late son Beau was when he served as Attorney General of Delaware—because he knew, as I know, that it works. It is especially important now, as State and local governments across the country continue to climb back from the once-in-a-century economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 last year. With their budgets decimated, countless communities were forced to cut essential services in 2020, including law enforcement and social services, just as a second public health epidemic of gun violence threatened the safety of their cities and towns. To help keep our communities safe, my Administration has provided local leaders with guidance on how American Rescue Plan funds can be used to help reduce violent crime and ensure public safety. I am also committed to investing in mental health services, drug treatment and prevention programs, services for people experiencing homelessness, and community violence intervention. Community violence intervention programs are vital to preventing violence before it occurs, and they have a proven track record of reducing crime by up to 60 percent in cities across our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also working to ensure that police departments have the resources they need to serve their communities safely and effectively. Communities experiencing a surge in gun violence can make use of $350 billion in State and local funding included in the American Rescue Plan to hire law enforcement officers and advance community policing strategies. I have also proposed an additional $300 million in my budget for next year to support community policing across our country. As I seek that additional funding, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services at the Department of Justice will continue to provide grants for community policing pilot projects and hiring local police officers—including funding prioritization for officers who will live in the communities they serve. These new resources will allow departments to implement community policing strategies and strengthen police-community partnerships.</FP>
    <FP>
        At its core, community policing is about building trust and mutual respect between police and communities—important goals that can only be reached when we have accountability and faith in our justice system. That's why I strongly support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would 
        <PRTPAGE P="225"/>
        deliver meaningful accountability, improved transparency, and the resources necessary to support community policing and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Although that bill is not yet law, my Administration will continue to consult with the law enforcement and civil rights communities to achieve reforms that advance safety, dignity, and equal justice for all Americans.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through October 9, 2021, as National Community Policing Week. I call upon law enforcement agencies, elected officials, and all Americans to observe this week by recognizing ways to improve public safety, build trust, and strengthen community relationships.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Child Health Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Nothing is more vital to our country's future than our children's health and well-being. Each year on Child Health Day, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that every child in America has equal access to quality and affordable health care, child care, and education so that they can thrive and reach their full potential.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound negative impact on the health and well-being of our Nation's children. A year of isolation from friends, extended family, and daily activities due to school closures and remote learning, as well as the loss of loved ones to the pandemic, has taken a tremendous toll on their mental health—and caused significant learning loss that may never be fully redressed. Families are also finding it harder to support their children during the pandemic, with many struggling to pay for expenses such as food, rent, health care, and transportation. And as scientists rigorously and independently review COVID-19 vaccines for children under age 12, too many of our kids returning to school—and the families they return to at the end of each school day—face unnecessary risks because there are not universal masking policies.</FP>
    <FP>
        We owe it to our children to do everything in our power to support their safe and healthy development. Because our Nation's schools play a critical role in safeguarding our children's health and well-being, my Administration has made it a top priority to ensure that all students can access full-time, in-person instruction so that they can achieve their highest aspirations. My American Rescue Plan continues to deliver for schools—including $130 billion to ensure that every child can safely access full-time, in-
        <PRTPAGE P="226"/>
        person instruction and that schools can mitigate the risk of COVID-19 in the classroom. My Administration is committed to supporting school-based health programs, which is why my American Rescue Plan also provides States and school districts with billions of dollars for schools to bring on additional nurses, counselors, social workers, and more to address student needs, allowing teachers to stay focused on teaching. To further support children's success in school, I strongly encourage families to visit their pediatric providers for well-child visits and immunizations—including the COVID-19 vaccine for children age 12 and up.
    </FP>
    <FP>My American Rescue Plan is also delivering critical resources to address the mental health needs of children, including $1.5 billion to support the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, which provides much needed services to children with serious emotional disturbances. The law also provides $20 million to support youth suicide prevention and $30 million to expand Project AWARE, which supports wellness and resiliency programs in educational settings. It has invested $80 million to expand the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access Program, which provides telehealth services for children and adolescents with mental health conditions identified during routine visits, making mental health care more accessible nationwide, including for young people in Tribal and remote areas.</FP>
    <FP>Additionally, the American Rescue Plan continues to deliver pandemic relief to families through a $150 million investment in the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program to improve maternal and child health. The law also provides funding to support families with essential emergency supplies, including diapers, food, water, and hand sanitizer. Finally, the American Rescue Plan is lowering health insurance premiums for millions of Americans—positioning us to cut child poverty in America by nearly half.</FP>
    <FP>We need to invest in the healthy development of all our children—and that means helping parents with the costs of raising a family. That is why my Administration worked hard to expand the Child Tax Credit, which is putting money directly in the pockets of families with children each month to help pay for food, rent, a new pair of kids' shoes, or whatever else working parents need.</FP>
    <FP>On Child Heath Day, we recommit ourselves to ensuring that our children can live long and healthy lives. Together, we can help all of our Nation's children stay healthy and learn, develop, and grow up to reach their full potential.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation in observance of this day.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 4, 2021, as Child Health Day.

Today, German-Americans make up one of the largest ancestry groups in our country, with more than 43 million Americans of German heritage living in the United States. Their influence has been felt in each successive generation, and their contributions to the United States have been innumerable. On German-American Day, we celebrate the German-Americans who continue to enhance our Nation with their talents, skills, knowledge, and rich cultural heritage.</FP>
    <FP>The contributions of German-Americans are woven into the fabric of America, touching our lives every day. From the Brooklyn Bridge to airplanes, jeans to pianos, the food we eat to the beer we drink—German-Americans have invented, built, and influenced some of the most iconic American products and institutions. Generations of German-Americans have served our Nation as first responders, public servants, scientists, entrepreneurs, farmers and ranchers, authors, and athletes among many other occupations.</FP>
    <FP>The strong ties between the people of America and Germany that have arisen since the end of World War II reflect the common bonds our countries enjoy.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since 1946, the National School Lunch Program has provided nutritionally balanced, low-cost or no-cost lunches in our schools, improving our children's health and well-being. School meals are one of the most powerful ways in which our Nation promotes health and ensures children receive the nutritious food they need to be successful in the classroom. Today, tens of millions of children participate in the program. During National School Lunch Week, we recognize the integral role the National School Lunch Program plays in contributing to student health, reducing child hunger, and supporting American agriculture.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of the National School Lunch Program for millions of children who rely on school meals. During the darkest days of the pandemic when businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and millions of Americans turned to food banks to feed their families, school meals remained a consistent source of quality nutrition.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is dedicated to nutrition, food security, and ensuring that school meals are accessible to all children. This includes a commitment to providing safe, healthy meals free of charge to children, especially as the pandemic continues to compromise the food and nutrition security of our most vulnerable students. To help the millions of families who struggled to provide meals for their children during the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan provided additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for those in need.</FP>
    <FP>School meals would not be possible without the remarkable work of our Nation's farmers and food producers. This year, my Administration awarded $12 million in Farm to School Grants to 176 grantees—the most projects the Federal Government has funded since the program began in 2013. These grants increase access to locally produced foods, enhance agricultural education for students, and support local farmers. Strong partnership with local farmers is key to our efforts to improve nutrition security and increase access to healthy foods in schools. During National School Lunch Week, we show our appreciation to our local farmers who supply the foods that keep our children well-nourished and ready to learn.</FP>
    <FP>
        During National School Lunch Week, we also honor the commitment and dedication of the school nutrition professionals who have gone above and beyond to continue providing meals to students despite the continuing challenges of a once-in-a-century pandemic. They have continually found new and creative ways to meet the moment and ensure that students who depend on school meals for nourishment are able to grow and thrive.

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The voyage of Leif Erikson and his valiant crew—bold explorers from Scandinavia, believed to have been the first Europeans to reach the shores of North America—has been a source of inspiration to Nordic Americans for generations. Although they made landfall more than a millennium ago, their historic journey still embodies the spirit of exploration and the ongoing contributions of Nordic Americans to the diversity of our great Nation.</FP>
    <FP>Eight centuries after Leif Erikson's expedition, on October 9, 1825, six Norwegian families arrived in New York City in search of freedom and opportunity. This first group of organized Norwegian immigrants to the United States blazed a new path that fellow Norwegians—as well as Danes, Finns, Icelanders, and Swedes—soon followed, establishing communities in the Great Lakes States, in the northern Great Plains, in enclaves among northern United States cities, and elsewhere across our country. These Northern European settlers have become part of America's rich tapestry, and through service, sacrifice, and countless contributions they have fortified America's culture, society, and economy.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, more than 11 million Americans proudly trace their ancestry to Nordic countries. Nordic Americans are leaders in our communities—public officials serving their constituents, law enforcement officers and service members defending our Nation, doctors and nurses, educators, artists, essential workers leading us through the pandemic, visionaries creating new businesses, and so many other important roles. Our Nation is stronger and more dynamic because of the contributions of Nordic Americans. On Leif Erikson Day, we express our appreciation for the many contributions of Nordic Americans, who have enhanced American society and strengthened our cultural diversity.
        <PRTPAGE P="230"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>While the great era of Scandinavian immigration occurred more than a century ago, the legacy of Nordic immigrants endures, along with the values and interests we share with their original homelands—including increasing opportunity for all and recognizing the inherent dignity of every human being. We share mutual commitments to democracy, freedom, human rights, rule of law, security, and prosperity, and Nordic countries remain some of our most reliable military allies and economic partners, helping us meet the shared challenges of our time. The United States greatly values our continued friendship.</FP>
    <FP>To honor Leif Erikson, son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, and to celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9th of each year as “Leif Erikson Day.”</FP>

While he intended to end his quest in Asia, his 10-week journey instead landed him on the shores of the Bahamas, making Columbus the first of many Italian explorers to arrive in what would later become known as the Americas.</FP>
    <FP>Many Italians would follow his path in the centuries to come, risking poverty, starvation, and death in pursuit of a better life. Today, millions of Italian Americans continue to enrich our country's traditions and culture and make lasting contributions to our Nation—they are educators, health care workers, scientists, first responders, military service members, and public servants, among so many other vital roles.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, we also acknowledge the painful history of wrongs and atrocities that many European explorers inflicted on Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities. It is a measure of our greatness as a Nation that we do not seek to bury these shameful episodes of our past—that we face them honestly, we bring them to the light, and we do all we can to address them. 
        <PRTPAGE P="231"/>
        For Native Americans, western exploration ushered in a wave of devastation: violence perpetrated against Native communities, displacement and theft of Tribal homelands, the introduction and spread of disease, and more. On this day, we recognize this painful past and recommit ourselves to investing in Native communities, upholding our solemn and sacred commitments to Tribal sovereignty, and pursuing a brighter future centered on dignity, respect, justice, and opportunity for all people.
    </FP>
    <FP>In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage 529 years ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as “Columbus Day.” Today, let this day be one of reflection—on America's spirit of exploration, on the courage and contributions of Italian Americans throughout the generations, on the dignity and resilience of Tribal Nations and Indigenous communities, and on the work that remains ahead of us to fulfill the promise of our Nation for all.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as Columbus Day. I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.</FP>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-born hero of the American Revolution, who gave his life 242 years ago in defense of our cause to establish a free and independent Nation. Known as the “Father of the American Cavalry” for his leadership and military skills, General Pulaski's service and sacrifice remain a shining example of the countless contributions that immigrants have made to help build our great Nation.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, General Pulaski's legacy and contributions to our democracy are honored by more than 9 million Polish-Americans in communities across our country. Polish-Americans have played an integral role in the growth of our Nation—defending our country in uniform, protecting our communities as first responders, starting new businesses and growing our economy, educating the next generation of American leaders, working on the front lines of the pandemic, and creating art that inspires us, to name just a few examples.
        <PRTPAGE P="232"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In 1929, the Congress recognized General Pulaski's enduring impact on American society by declaring October 11, “General Pulaski Memorial Day.” Eighty years later, the Congress granted him honorary United States citizenship. Today, States, cities, and communities all across our Nation celebrate the memory of General Casimir Pulaski at parks, schools, and landmarks that bear his name—serving as a reminder of his heroism and the sacrifice he made in defense of our newly formed Nation.</FP>
    <FP>On this day, we celebrate the life of General Casimir Pulaski and the ideals and democratic values for which he bravely gave his life—values shared by the United States and Poland, which underpin the enduring bond of friendship between our countries.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as “General Pulaski Memorial Day.” I encourage all Americans to commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to General Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the freedom of our great Nation.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Indigenous Peoples' Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Since time immemorial, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians have built vibrant and diverse cultures—safeguarding land, language, spirit, knowledge, and tradition across the generations. On Indigenous Peoples' Day, our Nation celebrates the invaluable contributions and resilience of Indigenous peoples, recognizes their inherent sovereignty, and commits to honoring the Federal Government's trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our country was conceived on a promise of equality and opportunity for all people—a promise that, despite the extraordinary progress we have made through the years, we have never fully lived up to. That is especially true when it comes to upholding the rights and dignity of the Indigenous people who were here long before colonization of the Americas began. For generations, Federal policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace Native people and eradicate Native cultures. Today, we recognize Indigenous peoples' resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect of American society. We also recommit to supporting a new, brighter future of promise and equity for Tribal Nations—a future grounded in Tribal sovereignty and respect for the human rights of Indigenous people in the Americas and around the world.
        <PRTPAGE P="233"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In the first week of my Administration, I issued a memorandum reaffirming our Nation's solemn trust and treaty obligations to American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations and directed the heads of executive departments and agencies to engage in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal officials. It is a priority of my Administration to make respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance the cornerstone of Federal Indian policy. History demonstrates that Native American people—and our Nation as a whole—are best served when Tribal governments are empowered to lead their communities and when Federal officials listen to and work together with Tribal leaders when formulating Federal policy that affects Tribal Nations.</FP>
    <FP>The contributions that Indigenous peoples have made throughout history—in public service, entrepreneurship, scholarship, the arts, and countless other fields—are integral to our Nation, our culture, and our society. Indigenous peoples have served, and continue to serve, in the United States Armed Forces with distinction and honor—at one of the highest rates of any group—defending our security every day. And Native Americans have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, working essential jobs and carrying us through our gravest moments. Further, in recognition that the pandemic has harmed Indigenous peoples at an alarming and disproportionate rate, Native communities have led the way in connecting people with vaccination, boasting some of the highest rates of any racial or ethnic group.</FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government has a solemn obligation to lift up and invest in the future of Indigenous people and empower Tribal Nations to govern their own communities and make their own decisions. We must never forget the centuries-long campaign of violence, displacement, assimilation, and terror wrought upon Native communities and Tribal Nations throughout our country. Today, we acknowledge the significant sacrifices made by Native peoples to this country—and recognize their many ongoing contributions to our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>On Indigenous Peoples' Day, we honor America's first inhabitants and the Tribal Nations that continue to thrive today. I encourage everyone to celebrate and recognize the many Indigenous communities and cultures that make up our great country.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as Indigenous Peoples' Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our diverse history and the Indigenous peoples who contribute to shaping this Nation.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">International Day of the Girl, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The growth and development of the world's economies, institutions, and nations rest on all girls having equal rights and opportunities. Ensuring that girls can reach their full potential is not just a moral imperative, it is a strategic one as well. The status of women and the peace and prosperity of nations are inextricably linked. When girls do well, we all do well. When we invest in the education of girls, our communities are healthier and our economies are stronger. When we empower girls to lead, our peace processes, global health and humanitarian efforts, and climate negotiations are more sustainable and resilient. When we invest in women- and girl-led movements, our democracies grow more stable and more prosperous. On this International Day of the Girl, we commit ourselves to ensuring opportunity and equality for all girls.</FP>
    <FP>Girls across our Nation and the world face gender bias and discrimination, subjecting them to harmful circumstances that impede their safety, stability, education, and opportunity. This has been especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has upended the lives of too many girls around the globe, exacerbating disparities and underscoring what we have long known: that during times of crisis, girls—especially girls of color and those from underserved and low-income communities—face disproportionate challenges.</FP>
    <FP>In the United States, girls contend with entrenched barriers to achieving gender equity. Despite Title IX protections, girls continue to lack equal opportunity and resources in education and leadership, and gender stereotypes continue to inhibit their participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, undermining their access to the stable and good-paying jobs. Girls' education is further undermined by the threat of sexual assault, harassment, and other forms of gender-based violence, with 1-in-4 young women on college campuses today facing sexual assault. Girls of color and girls from underserved communities contend with additional longstanding disparities. Black girls experience disproportionate rates of school discipline and are overrepresented in our juvenile justice system. LGBTQI+ girls face elevated rates of gender-based violence and are subject to bullying, harassment, and online abuse. Transgender girls are increasingly excluded from sports and equal access to school facilities. Girls with disabilities face inequitable access to education.</FP>
    <FP>
        Globally, girls confront persistent and structural barriers that impede their full participation. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, 130 million girls across the world were not in school, and today, there are an additional 11 million girls who have been forced to stop their education, undermining future economic growth, health, and development. An estimated 33,000 girls are made to enter into child, early, or forced marriages every day, fueling an intergenerational cycle of poverty that is difficult to break. Girls face a range of other challenges, from harmful practices like female genital cutting to unintended pregnancy and from discriminatory laws and exclusion from civic and political processes to concerns about safety, harassment, and 
        <PRTPAGE P="235"/>
        sexual assault. Too often, social norms that ascribe low value to girls' lives functionally limit their rights and opportunities across public and private life.
    </FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened preexisting public health, economic, political, and caregiving crises, which disproportionately impact girls worldwide. As health systems become more strained, girls face increased barriers to accessing basic health care. In many parts of the world, those who are part of vulnerable and marginalized communities continue to face challenges in accessing routine childhood immunizations, preventative screenings, and sexual and reproductive health services. As schools closed, caregiving burdens fell on girls across the globe, and girls were often significantly less likely to have access to the devices required for virtual schooling due to a global digital gender divide. Many countries have also reported a rise in rates of gender-based violence, both offline and online, including against female journalists, activists, and leaders who are being further excluded from critical rebuilding efforts. The mental health of girls—who already disproportionately face high incidence of reported anxiety and other mental health issues—is also suffering. We have also seen an increase in visits to emergency rooms of teenage girls across our Nation for reasons related to self-harm, including suicide attempts. An essential part of building back better must be elevating the status of girls as we address these shared crises.</FP>
    <FP>On this International Day of the Girl, our Nation stands firmly and proudly in our commitment to protecting and advancing the rights of girls, in all their diversity, both at home and abroad. That is why, earlier this year, I signed an Executive Order to establish the White House Gender Policy Council and ensure a whole-of-government approach to advancing gender equity and equality. This month my Administration will release the first-ever United States Government National Gender Strategy, outlining our vision and our priorities to advance equal opportunity for people of all genders. From combating gender discrimination in education and preventing gender-based violence offline and online, to increasing pathways to STEM and promoting gender parity and diversity in leadership and democratic processes, my Administration will work to empower girls in every facet of life. And by recognizing the constraints that gender-based violence places on the lives of millions of girls around the world, we will also develop the first-ever United States National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence and update the United States' Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally.</FP>
    <FP>Our vision for the future is one where every girl can live free from violence, discrimination, and bias. We are committed to a future where girls can dream boldly and lead ambitiously as heads of families, communities, corporations, and governments; where their voices are not only heard, but amplified; and where they can lead the charge against 21st century challenges, drive innovation, and compete and succeed in the workforce of the future.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2021, as International Day of the Girl.

    <EAR>Proc. 10285</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Bears Ears National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>President Barack Obama's establishment of the Bears Ears National Monument in Proclamation 9558 of December 28, 2016, represented the culmination of more than a century of efforts to protect the ancestral homeland of Tribal Nations that all refer to the area by the same name—Hoon'Naqvut (Hopi), Shash Jaa' (Navajo), Kwiyagatu Nukavachi (Ute), and Ansh An Lashokdiwe (Zuni): Bears Ears. Preserving the sacred landscape and unique cultural resources in the Bears Ears region was an impetus for passage of the Antiquities Act in 1906. As early as 1904, advocates for protection of cultural landscapes described for the Congress the tragedy of the destruction of objects of historic and scientific interest across the American Southwest and identified the Bears Ears region as one of seven areas in need of immediate protection. Nevertheless, for more than 100 years, indigenous people, historians, conservationists, scientists, archaeologists, and other groups advocated unsuccessfully for protection of the Bears Ears landscape. It was not until the Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and Pueblo of Zuni united in a common vision to protect these sacred lands and requested permanent protection from President Obama that Bears Ears National Monument became a reality. Few national monuments more clearly meet the Antiquities Act's criteria for protection than the Bears Ears Buttes and surrounding areas. This proclamation confirms, restores, and supplements the boundaries and protections provided by Proclamation 9558, including the continued reservation of land added to the monument by Proclamation 9681 of December 4, 2017.</FP>
    <FP>As Proclamation 9558 recognizes, the greater Bears Ears landscape, characterized by deep sandstone canyons, broad desert mesas, towering monoliths, forested mountaintops dotted with lush meadows, and the striking Bears Ears Buttes, has supported indigenous people of the Southwest from time immemorial and continues to be sacred land to the Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and Pueblo of Zuni. Approximately two dozen other Tribal Nations and Pueblos have cultural ties to the area as well.</FP>
    <FP>
        Describing as much as 13,000 years of human occupation of the Bears Ears landscape, Proclamation 9558 contextualizes the compelling need to protect one of the most extraordinary cultural landscapes in the United States. The proclamation describes the landscape's unique density of significant 
        <PRTPAGE P="237"/>
        cultural, historical, and archaeological artifacts spanning thousands of years, including remains of single family homes, ancient cliff dwellings, large villages, granaries, kivas, towers, ceremonial sites, prehistoric steps cut into cliff faces, and a prehistoric road system that connected the people of Bears Ears to each other and possibly beyond. Proclamation 9558 also describes the cultural significance and importance of the area, exemplified by the petroglyphs, pictographs, and recent rock writings left by the indigenous people that have inhabited the area since time immemorial.
    </FP>
    <FP>In addition to cultural and historic sites, Proclamation 9558 describes the Bears Ears landscape's unique geology, biology, ecology, paleontology, and topography. The proclamation identifies geologic formations rich with fossils that provide a rare and relatively complete picture of the paleoenvironment, striking landscapes, unique landforms, and rare and important plant and animal species. While not objects of historic and scientific interest designated for protection, the proclamation also describes other resources in the area, historic grazing, and world class outdoor recreation opportunities—including rock climbing, hunting, hiking, backpacking, canyoneering, whitewater rafting, mountain biking, and horseback riding—that support a booming travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic opportunity for local communities.</FP>
    <FP>To protect this singular and sacred landscape, President Obama reserved approximately 1.35 million acres through Proclamation 9558 as the smallest area compatible with protection of the objects identified within the boundaries of the monument. He also established the Bears Ears Commission to ensure that management of the monument would be guided by, and benefit from, expertise of Tribal Nations and traditional and historical knowledge of the area.</FP>
    <FP>On December 4, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Proclamation 9681 to reduce the lands within the monument by more than 1.1 million acres. In doing so, Proclamation 9681 removes protection from objects of historic and scientific interest across the Bears Ears landscape, including some objects that Proclamation 9558 specifically identifies by name for protection. Multiple parties challenged Proclamation 9681 in Federal court, asserting that it exceeds the President's authority under the Antiquities Act.</FP>
    <FP>Restoring the Bears Ears National Monument honors the special relationship between the Federal Government and Tribal Nations, correcting the exclusion of lands and resources profoundly sacred to Tribal Nations, and ensuring the long-term protection of, and respect for, this remarkable and revered region. Given the unique nature and cultural significance of the objects identified across the Bears Ears landscape, the threat of damage and destruction to those objects, their spiritual, cultural, and historical significance to Tribal Nations, and the insufficiency of the protections afforded in the absence of Antiquities Act protections, the reservation described below is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest named in this proclamation and Proclamation 9558.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Bears Ears landscape—bordered by the Colorado River to the west, the San Juan River and the Navajo Nation to the south, low bluffs and high mesas to the east and north, and Canyonlands National Park to the northwest, and brimming with towering sandstone spires, serpentine canyons, awe-inspiring natural bridges and arches, as well as the famous twin Bears 
        <PRTPAGE P="238"/>
        Ears Buttes standing sentinel over the sacred region—is not just a series of isolated objects, but is, itself, an object of historic and scientific interest requiring protection under the Antiquities Act. Bears Ears is sacred land of spiritual significance, a historic homeland, and a place of belonging for indigenous people from the Southwest. Bears Ears is a living, breathing landscape, that—owing to the area's arid environment and overall remoteness, as well as the building techniques that its inhabitants employed—retains remarkable and spiritually significant evidence of indigenous use and habitation since time immemorial, including from the Paleoindian Period, through the time of the Basketmakers and Ancestral Pueblos, to the more recent Navajo and Ute period, and continuing to this day. There are innumerable objects of historic or scientific interest within this extraordinary landscape. Some of the objects are also sacred to Tribal Nations, are sensitive, rare, or vulnerable to vandalism and theft, or are dangerous to visit and, therefore, revealing their specific names and locations could pose a danger to the objects or the public. The variety, density, and prevalence of these objects, such as prehistoric roads, structures, shrines, ceremonial sites, graves, pots, baskets, tools, petroglyphs, pictographs, and items of clothing, all contribute to the uniqueness of this region and underscore its sacred nature and living spiritual significance to indigenous people.
    </FP>
    <FP>Many of the Tribal Nations that trace their ancestral origin to this area and continue their spiritual practices on these lands today view Bears Ears as a part of the personal identity of their members and as a cultural living space—a landscape where their traditions began, where their ancestors engaged in and handed down cultural practices, and where they developed and refined complex protocols for caring for the land. The Bears Ears region is also a tangible location that is integral to indigenous ceremonial practices, cultural traditions, and the sustainment of the daily lives of indigenous peoples. Since time immemorial, the lands of the Bears Ears region have fostered indigenous identity and spirituality. Indigenous people lived, hunted, gathered, prayed, and built homes in the Bears Ears region. As a result, each geographic subregion and the mountains, canyons, mesa tops, ridges, rivers, and streams therein that make up the Bears Ears landscape hold cultural significance. These individual locales come together as objects of historic and scientific interest—many of which have spiritual significance to indigenous people and are located across this living landscape—to tell stories, facilitate the practice of traditions, and serve as a mnemonic device that elders use to teach younger generations where they came from, who they are, and how to live. Resources found throughout the Bears Ears region, including wildlife and plants that are native to the region, continue to serve integral roles in the development and practice of indigenous ceremonial and cultural lifeways. From family gatherings, dances, and ceremonies held on these sacred lands, to gathering roots, berries, firewood, pinon nuts, weaving materials, and medicines across the region, Bears Ears remains an essential landscape that members of Tribal Nations regularly visit to heal, practice their spirituality, pray, rejuvenate, and connect with their history.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Bears Ears region is also important to, and shows recent evidence of, non-Native migrants to the area. From the smoothed-over surfaces of the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail to the historic cattle-ranching cabins, and the convoluted series of passages and hideouts used by men like Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other members of the Wild Bunch on the Outlaw 
        <PRTPAGE P="239"/>
        Trail, including Hideout Canyon, the Bears Ears landscape conveys the story of westward expansion of European Americans and the settlement of Latter-day Saint communities in southern Utah. Hispanic sheep herders from New Mexico also migrated into this area during the late 1800s, and many of their descendants continue to live in local communities.
    </FP>
    <FP>Despite millennia of human habitation, the Bears Ears landscape remains one of the most ecologically intact and least-roaded regions in the contiguous United States. As a result, the area continues to provide habitat to a variety of threatened, endangered, sensitive, endemic, or otherwise rare species of wildlife, fish, and plants. The area also contains a diverse array of species that benefit from the preservation of the landscape's intact ecosystems.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Bears Ears landscape also tells the stories of epochs past. The area's exposed geologic formations provide a continuous record of vertebrate life in North America as well as a rich history of invertebrate fossils. The Chinle Formation, and the Wingate, Kayenta, and Navajo Formations above it, demonstrate how the Triassic Period transitioned into the Jurassic Period and provide critical insight into both how dinosaurs dominated terrestrial ecosystems and how our mammalian ancestors evolved. The discovery of several taxa, including a prosauropod that gets its name from a Navajo word tied to the region where it was found, the archosauromorph 
        <E T="03">Crosbysaurus harrisae</E>
        , and a unique phytosaur, have occurred exclusively within Bears Ears or have significantly extended an extinct species' known range. While paleontologists have only recently begun to systematically survey and study much of the fossil record in this region, experts are confident that scientifically important paleontological resources remain to be discovered, and future exploration will greatly expand our understanding of prehistoric life on the Colorado Plateau.
    </FP>
    <FP>The landscape itself is composed of several areas, each of which is unique and an object of scientific and historic interest requiring protection under the Antiquities Act. Near the center is the Bears Ears Buttes and Headwaters, the location of the iconic twin buttes, which soar over the surrounding landscape and maintain watch over the ancestral home of numerous Tribal Nations. Containing dense fir and aspen forests that provide firewood to heat homes as well as powerful medicines and habitat for wild game species, Tribal Nations view the high elevation oasis as the key to life in the Bears Ears region. The Bears Ears Buttes also hold historical significance to the Navajo people, as the landscape and natural cliff dwellings served as hiding places to escape the United States military during the forced Long Walk, where more than 11,000 Navajo were marched up to 450 miles on foot to internment camps in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Many Navajo hid in the remote canyons to avoid the forced removal from their traditional homelands in the Southwest by the United States from 1864 to 1868.</FP>
    <FP>
        In the northern part of the Bears Ears landscape lies Indian Creek, the home of a world-renowned canyon characterized by sheer red cliffs and spires of exposed and eroded layers of Navajo, Kayenta, Wingate, and Cedar Mesa Sandstone, including the iconic North and South Six-Shooter Peaks. The canyon includes famous vertical cracks striating its sandstone walls and the area provides important habitat for a multitude of plant and 
        <PRTPAGE P="240"/>
        animal species. Indian Creek's palisades provide eyries for peregrine falcons and potential nesting sites for bald and golden eagles, and the Lockhart Basin area and Donnelly Canyon contain Mexican spotted owl habitat. The Indian Creek area further provides critical winter grounds for big-game species such as mule deer, elk, and bighorn sheep and potential habitat for endangered fish and threatened plant species. The prominent Bridger Jack and Lavender Mesas are home to largely unaltered relict plant communities composed of pinyon-juniper woodlands interspersed with small sagebrush islands. It is also in Indian Creek that one can find Newspaper Rock, a massive petroglyph panel displaying a notable concentration of rock writings from persons of the Basketmaker and Ancestral Pueblo periods, the Ute and Navajo people who still live in the Four Corners area and beyond, and early settlers of European descent. Indian Creek also contains possible evidence of trade with cultures extending into Mesoamerica, including a thousand-year-old ornamental sash found in the area made from azure and scarlet macaw feathers as well as a petroglyph featuring a macaw-like bird figure. Shay Canyon is a side canyon that houses extensive, well-preserved petroglyph panels from multiple prehistoric periods. The panels contain a unique rock writing style that is believed to be both Freemont and Ancestral Pueblo in origin. Harts Point is an escarpment that provides spectacular views of the Indian Creek Canyon. These mesa tops also contain evidence of historic connections of indigenous people to the region. Additionally, Indian Creek provides fossilized trackways of early tetrapods and fossilized traces of marine and aquatic creatures such as clams, crayfish, fish, and aquatic reptiles dating to the Triassic Period.
    </FP>
    <FP>Southwest of Indian Creek and geographically nestled between the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park, the Dark Canyon Wilderness area, and the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, lie Beef Basin and Fable Valley, areas characterized by well-preserved Ancestral Pueblo surface sites—including freestanding Pueblo masonry structures and towers—as well as petroglyphs and pictographs. The areas are unique in their high concentration of large, mesa-top Pueblo structures. Sites in this region may also provide evidence of some of the furthest north migration of Pueblo in the Mesa Verde region.</FP>
    <FP>Just south of Indian Creek, the westernmost edge of the Abajo Mountains forms the eastern boundary of the Bears Ears landscape. An island laccolith series of peaks and domes known also as the Blue Mountains due to the appearance of their heavily forested slopes contrasted against the red desert that surrounds them, the Abajo Mountains are rich in wildlife and home to several rare and sensitive plant species. As a result of the breadth of species, the Abajo Mountains have long been a traditional hunting ground for the indigenous people that have lived in the area and are held sacred by a number of Tribal Nations, including the Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni, and Ute Indian Tribes. These peaks represent the highest elevations in the Bears Ears landscape and provide unbroken views of the entire region.</FP>
    <FP>
        South of Beef Basin and Indian Creek, the landscape contains a number of sandstone canyons that drain the northern edge of the Abajo Mountains and Elk Ridge, including the Tuerto, Trough, Ruin, and North Cottonwood Canyons, at the bottom of which runs a perennial creek. Ancestral Pueblo sites within this area have special significance to the Pueblos of New Mexico, who identify these sites as part of their ancestral footprints that extend their traditional territory north of the Abajo Mountains. The area, which is 
        <PRTPAGE P="241"/>
        composed of both Cedar Mesa Sandstone and Chinle Formation deposits, has a very high potential for Permian and Triassic fossils.
    </FP>
    <FP>The South Cottonwood Canyon region, characterized by prominent sandstone escarpments surrounded by forests of pinyon, juniper, and Gambel oak, interspersed with stands of ponderosa pine and mixed conifers, is situated west of the Abajo Mountains and south of the prominent sandstone towers known as the Chippean Rocks. The isolated area contains intact cultural landscapes of early Ancestral Pueblo communities. Some sites are organized as a larger central village surrounded by smaller family-sized dwellings, while others are large and inaccessible granaries. This region is home to a diversity of wildlife, including Townsend's big-eared bats, beavers, and ringtail cats, as well as the Cliff Dwellers Pasture Research Natural Area, an ungrazed box canyon with a unique vegetative community and an imposing sandstone arch and natural bridge. The area also contains excellent big game habitat and is considered prime mule deer, elk, and black bear hunting grounds.</FP>
    <FP>Further west, South Cottonwood Canyon is home to a unique density of Pueblo I to early Pueblo II village sites that are considered important to both archaeologists and Tribal Nations. One site, a collapsed two-story block masonry structure that appears to be an early version of a great house, was built during a time when the development of this kind of community structure was only beginning in Chaco Canyon. More recently, the South Cottonwood Canyon area proved critical to the survival of the White Mesa Ute during Anglo settlement of southern Utah. Paleontologically, there is high potential fossil yield on both the west side of the area, which contains portions of the Triassic Period Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, and the east side, which is composed of Jurassic Period Glen Canyon Group Kayenta Formation. The area also provides critical habitat for Mexican spotted owls, peregrine falcons, golden eagles, and spotted bats.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Dark Canyon, Dry Mesa complex, located between Beef Basin and White Canyon, is wild and remote. In Dark Canyon—a canyon system that includes Peavine, Woodenshoe, and other minor tributaries—rock walls, which tower 3,000 feet above the canyon floor, provide a sense of solitude and isolation from the surrounding mesa tops. The canyon system, one of the only entirely intact and protected canyons from its headwaters on the Colorado Plateau to its confluence with the Colorado River, includes numerous hanging gardens, springs, and riparian areas and provides habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including known populations of Mexican spotted owl. Dry Mesa is relatively flat with stands of ponderosa pine, oak, and pinyon and juniper that provide foraging habitat for golden eagles and peregrine falcons. Many Tribal Nations have strong connections to sites in the area from three specific time periods: ancient hunter-gatherers during the Archaic period, Ancestral Pueblos during the Pueblo III period, and finally, Navajo, Ute, and Paiute families just before and during European migration into the Four Corners area. Visitors to the Dark Canyon Wilderness area will find the Doll House, a fully-intact and well-preserved single-room granary. Located at the bottom of Horse Pasture Canyon and Dark Canyon, visitors will also find Scorup Cabin, a line cabin originally built in Rig Canyon and later moved to its current location, that cowboys used as a summer camp while running cattle in the area. The area also contains exposures of Permian Period Cutler Group deposits that have a high potential to contain both vertebrate and invertebrate fossils.
        <PRTPAGE P="242"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The White Canyon region, west of Dark Canyon, is a remote area featuring an extensive complex of steep and narrow canyons cut through light-colored Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Once used by outlaws to evade authorities, the area's slot canyons, including the Black Hole, Fry Canyon, and Cheesebox Canyon, now draw adventurers in search of multi-day, technical canyoneering opportunities. The entire White Canyon area has a rich paleontological history. Research in the area is ongoing, but recent discoveries of track sites in the Triassic Moenkopi Formation and an assemblage of invertebrate burrows suggest that a diverse fauna once thrived here. Mollusks, phytosaurs, and possible theropod and ornithischian fossils have also been found in White Canyon.</FP>
    <FP>Located between the Abajo Mountains and the Colorado River, the high plateau of Elk Ridge provides stunning views of the surrounding canyons and the Bears Ears Buttes to the south. Visitors passing through the Notch, a naturally occurring narrow pass between north and south Elk Ridge, are treated to spectacular vistas of Dark Canyon to the west and Notch Canyon to the east. The area's higher elevations, which contain pockets of ancient Engelmann spruce, rare stands of old-growth ponderosa pine, aspen, and subalpine fir, and a genetically distinct population of Kachina daisy, provide welcome respite from the higher temperatures found in the region's lower elevations, especially during the summer. There is evidence that indigenous people have hunted and gathered plants on Elk Ridge for at least 8,000 years, a practice that continues today and is considered sacred by the Navajo Nation. Elk Ridge also has a long history of livestock grazing by Navajo and Ute families and later Anglo settlers. While the mesa top is primarily dry, water naturally occurs at the area's seeps and springs, as well as the ephemeral Duck Lake, a seasonal wetland located on top of Elk Ridge that results from snowmelt. The upper reaches of the ridge also contain Upper Triassic formations with a high potential to contain fossils.</FP>
    <FP>To the east of Elk Ridge lies a major system of canyons on National Forest System lands, including Hammond Canyon, Upper Arch Canyon, Texas Canyon, and Notch Canyon. This deeply incised canyon system is composed of stunning red sandstone walls, white pinnacles, lush green foliage, and several small waterfalls. Uniquely, the area also contains large sandstone towers and hoodoos in a forested setting. The Hammond Canyon area, which is central to the history of the White Mesa Utes, contains numerous Ancestral Pueblo sites, including cliff dwellings. Hammond Canyon also contains an Ancestral Pueblo village with structures and pottery from multiple Ancestral Pueblo periods. High fossil potential exists in both the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic Glen Canyon Sandstone of Hammond Canyon's lower half as well as the Permian Period Cedar Mesa Sandstone found in its upper half.</FP>
    <FP>
        Just south of Elk Ridge, Arch Canyon is a 12-mile long box canyon containing numerous arches, including Cathedral Arch, Angel Arch, and Keystone Arch. The area is teeming with fossilized remains, including numerous specimens from the Permian and Upper Permian eras. Cliff dwellings and hanging gardens are located throughout the canyon. Arch Canyon Great House, which spans the Pueblo II and III periods and contains pictographs and petroglyphs ranging from the Archaic to the historic periods, is located at the canyon's mouth. A perennial stream that provides potential habitat for sensitive fish species and for the threatened Navajo sedge is located in the canyon's bottom.
        <PRTPAGE P="243"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Mule Canyon, a 500-foot deep, 5-mile long chasm, is situated northeast of the Fish Creek area and southeast of the Bears Ears Buttes. Throughout the canyon, cliff dwellings and other archaeological sites are sheltered by rock walls composed of alternating layers of red and white sandstone. Among those are the stunning House on Fire, which has different masonry styles that indicate several episodes of construction and use. The area's rich archaeological history is also evidenced on the nearby tablelands, where the Mule Canyon Village site allows visitors to view the exposed masonry walls of ancient living quarters and a partially restored kiva. Recent research suggests that Ancestral Pueblos in this area may have cultivated a variety of plants that are uncommon across the wider landscape and persist to this day, such as the Four Corners potato, goosefoot, wolfberry, and sumac. Although similar cultivation may have been occurring near Ancestral Pueblo sites across the Bears Ears landscape, it appears to have been particularly prevalent in and around the Mule, South Cottonwood, Dry, Arch, and Owl Canyons.</FP>
    <FP>Tilted at almost 20 degrees and running along a north-south axis from the foothills of the Abajo Mountains, past the San Juan River, and onto the Navajo Nation, the serrated cliffs of the Comb Ridge monocline are visible from space and have both spiritual and practical significance to many Tribal Nations. It is in this area that one can find a series of alcoves in Whiskers Draw that have sheltered evidence of human habitation for thousands of years, including the site where Richard Wetherill first identified what we know today as the Basketmaker people, as well as Milk Ranch Point, where early Ancestral Pueblo farmers found refuge when the climate turned hotter and dryer at lower elevations. Comb Ridge, flanked on the west by Comb Wash and on the east by Butler Wash, holds additional evidence of centuries of human habitation, including cliff dwellings, such as the well-known Butler Wash Village and Monarch Cave, kivas, ceremonial sites, and rock writings, like the Procession Panel, Wolfman Panel, and Lower Butler Wash Panel, a wall-sized mural depicting San Juan Anthropomorph figures dating to the Basketmaker period that is considered important for understanding the daily life and rituals of the Basketmaker people. Chacoan roads as well as the handholds and steps carved into cliff faces found in this area formed part of the region's migration system and are integral to the story of the Bears Ears landscape. The Comb Ridge area also contains a rich paleontological history, including an Upper Triassic microvertebrate site with greater taxonomic diversity than any other published site of the same nature in Utah, and the earliest recorded instance of a giant arthropod trackway in Utah. Paleontologists have also found phytosaur and dinosaur fossils from the Triassic Period and have identified new species of plant-eating crocodile-like reptiles and rich bonebeds of lumbering sauropods in the area.</FP>
    <FP>
        South Cottonwood Wash is an extensive drainage just east of Comb Ridge that extends from the Abajo Mountains to the San Juan River near Bluff, Utah. The drainage contains at least three great houses as well as a number of alcove sites, and it has a high density of petroglyphs and pictographs, including a cave with more than 200 handprints in a variety of colors. There is also evidence of a Chacoan road that connected multiple great houses and kiva sites. These prehistoric transportation systems in the Bears Ears region are critical to understanding the trading patterns, economy, and 
        <PRTPAGE P="244"/>
        social organization of ancient Pueblo communities and the other major cultural centers with whom they interacted, such as Chaco Canyon.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        At the far southern end of the Bears Ears landscape lies Valley of the Gods, a broad expanse of sandstone monoliths, pinnacles, and other geological features of historic and scientific interest. Towering spires of red sandstone that rise from the valley floor are held sacred by the Navajo people, who view the formations as ancient warriors frozen in stone and places of power in which spirits reside. The austere valley, which is noteworthy in both its geology and ecology, provides habitat for 
        <E T="03">Eucosma navajoensis</E>
        , an endemic moth that lives nowhere else. The Mars-like landscape also contains evidence of our own planet's distant past, including early tetrapod trackways, Paleozoic freshwater sharks, ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes, giant primitive amphibians, and multiple unique taxa of mammal-like reptiles. Paleontologists have also uncovered notable plant macrofossils including ancestral conifers, giant horsetail-like plants, ferns the size of trees, and lycopsids (similar to modern clubmoss).
    </FP>
    <FP>The San Juan River forms the southern boundary of the Bears Ears landscape. One of the four sacred rivers that Tribal Nations believe were established by the gods to act as defensive guardians over their ancestral lands, the river is closely tied to traditional stories of creation, danger, protection, and healing. The Lime Ridge Clovis site demonstrates that the history of human occupation within the river corridor dates back at least 13,000 years. The Sand Island Petroglyph Panel presents petroglyphs primarily from the Basketmaker through the Pueblo III periods as well as more modern Navajo and Ute carvings. There are also a number of Ancestral Pueblo structures that are accessible by river, such as River House. Nearby San Juan Hill was the last major obstacle for the Hole-in-the-Rock expedition and presents visible evidence of the weary expedition's effort to cross Comb Ridge, including parts of a road, wagon ruts, and an inscription at the top of the ridge. The river corridor also contains a number of unique geologic formations, such as the well-known balancing rock at Mexican Hat, and provides important habitat for the threatened yellow-billed cuckoo and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. The river itself is home to two endangered fish species: Colorado pikeminnow, the largest minnow in North America, which is believed to have evolved more than 3 million years ago, and the razorback sucker, the only member of its genus.</FP>
    <FP>
        Cedar Mesa is located in the heart of the Bears Ears landscape, west of Comb Ridge and north of the San Juan River. Ranging from approximately 4,000 to 6,500 feet in elevation, the approximately 400-square mile plateau is of deep significance to Tribal Nations. Characterized by pinyon-juniper forests on the mesa tops and canyons along its periphery, the entirety of Cedar Mesa is an object of scientific and historic interest, providing a broader context for the individual resources found there. It is the density of world-class cultural resources found throughout the remote, sloping plateau and its numerous canyons that make Cedar Mesa truly unique. For example, an open-twined yucca fiber sandal believed to be more than 7,000 years old was discovered in a dry shelter located in a narrow slickrock canyon in Cedar Mesa. Moon House is an example of iconic Pueblo-decorated architecture and was likely the last occupied site on Cedar Mesa. On the top of the plateau, Chacoan roads connect several Ancestral Pueblo great houses that show architectural influence from the Chaco Canyon region as 
        <PRTPAGE P="245"/>
        well as ceramics that demonstrate both historic and modern Pueblo connections. And in the heart of Cedar Mesa, a multi-room, multi-story great house contains kivas with distinctive Chacoan features that are much larger than kivas found elsewhere on Cedar Mesa. Today, Cedar Mesa is home to bighorn sheep, but fossil evidence in the area's sandstone has revealed large, mammal-like reptiles that burrowed into the sand to survive the blistering heat of the end of the Permian Period, when the region was dominated by a seaside desert. Later, during the Upper Triassic Period, seasonal monsoons flooded an ancient river system that fed a vast desert here. Salvation Knoll, a point from which lost Latter-day Saint pioneers were able to obtain their bearings on Christmas Day in 1879, is also located in the area.
    </FP>
    <FP>Cedar Mesa is striated with deep chasms housing remarkably intact Ancestral Pueblo sites. John's Canyon and Slickhorn Canyon, which empty into the San Juan River in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area to the south, contain numerous petroglyphs, pictographs, and Ancestral Pueblo structures built into elongated alcoves on buff-colored cliffs. Similarly, the canyons on the east side of Cedar Mesa hold a significant density of archaeological sites providing a glimpse into the region's past, including rock writings and Ancestral Pueblo dwellings. The Citadel cliff dwelling is just one example of the striking Ancestral Pueblo sites located in Road Canyon, while other sites include painted handprints and evidence of daily life left by Ancestral Pueblos. Located to the north of Road Canyon, the Fish Canyon area contains a number of Pueblo structures. The Fish Canyon area also contains one of the few perennial streams in the area and an important potential habitat for the Mexican spotted owl. Finally, the rust-colored, 145-foot span of Nevills Arch awaits those who make the challenging trek down Owl Canyon. Opening to a height of 80 feet and named after Norman Nevills, the first boatman to take paying customers on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, the arch creates a striking window to the sky on the upper reaches of the canyon walls.</FP>
    <FP>
        Grand Gulch, a mostly dry canyon that meanders for nearly 50 miles on the western edge of Cedar Mesa and is replete with thousands of cliff dwellings and rock writing sites, likely contains the highest concentration of Ancestral Pueblo sites on the Colorado Plateau. Initially occupied in the Basketmaker II and III periods, Grand Gulch's initial inhabitants left pictographs and constructed shallow pithouses and camps on the mesa top and dry shelters for storage. One pictograph dating from this time period depicting two large, anthropomorphic figures is of special religious significance to Tribal Nations. Grand Gulch also contains a multitude of Pueblo II to III sites and was one of the first prehistoric national historic districts designated on the National Register of Historic Places. The area contains the Turkey Pen site, which is believed to provide some of the earliest evidence of turkey domestication in North America, a pristine kiva in a remote canyon bend, and countless other unique Pueblo structures, such as Junction Village, a large Pueblo habitation site; Split Level Village, a multi-level Pueblo habitation; and Bannister House, a habitation consisting of two relatively intact structures and a spring at the base of the cliff face. Grand Gulch also contains unique artifacts, such as a tattoo needle, a site containing a multichromatic pictograph of a mask, important historic archaeological inscriptions from the Wetherill expedition, and a multitude of other rock writings.
        <PRTPAGE P="246"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Kane Gulch is a tributary canyon of Grand Gulch incised through Cedar Mesa Sandstone and clogged with house-sized boulders. The canyon houses an aspen grove—an uncommon occurrence at such elevations in the desert—and contains a number of archaeological sites that are perched on canyon walls high above cottonwood trees that provide welcomed shade to the riparian areas in the canyon bottom. Nearby, Bullet Canyon, which intersects with the upper reaches of Grand Gulch, also holds numerous structures, petroglyphs, pictographs, and other artifacts, such as the well-preserved Perfect Kiva—a partly restored kiva, accompanied by several rooms and other smaller structures.</FP>
    <FP>To the west of Cedar Mesa, the Clay Hills, Red House Cliffs, and Mike's Canyon form the southwest corner of the Bears Ears landscape. This remote and rarely visited area remains largely unstudied by scientists. Tool- and arrowhead-making sites, dwellings, and granaries in the lower reaches of the canyons indicate that they sustained Archaic, Basketmaker, and Ancestral Pueblo cultures. The area's unforgiving topography, composed of expansive stretches of slickrock periodically interrupted by deep canyons, challenged Latter-day Saint settlers that traveled along the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail and left wheel ruts and other traces of pioneer life. The harsh ecosystem still supports a herd of desert bighorn sheep throughout the year, and in the canyon bottoms, including Mike's Canyon, intrepid beavers can be found in small areas of riparian habitat. The Clay Hills area contains the first discovery of vertebrate fossils from the Bears Ears region, which was also the first occurrence of a phytosaur identified in Utah.</FP>
    <FP>Standing alone west of Cedar Mesa and adjacent to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Mancos Mesa is likely the largest isolated slickrock mesa in southern Utah. Covering approximately 180 square miles, Mancos Mesa's roughly triangular shape is bounded by towering cliffs, some reaching more than 1,000 feet high. The entire area is dominated by Navajo Sandstone and is incised with canyons, including Moqui Canyon, a 20-mile canyon with sheer walls rising over 600 feet. The mesa, an ecological island in the sky, contains a relict plant community that supports Native perennial grasses, shrubs, and some cacti. Mancos Mesa also contains archaeological remains dating back 2,000 years and spanning across the Basketmaker II and III and Pueblo I, II, and III periods.</FP>

        Protection of the Bears Ears area will preserve its spiritual, cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. For more than 100 years, and sometimes predating the enactment of the Antiquities Act, Presidents, Members of Congress, Secretaries of the Interior, Tribal Nations, State and local governments, scientists, and local conservationists have understood and championed the need to protect the Bears Ears area. The area contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest and also includes other resources that contribute to the social and economic well-being of the area's modern communities as a result of world-class outdoor recreation opportunities, including unparalleled rock climbing available at places like the canyons in Indian Creek; the paradise for hikers, birders, and horseback riders provided in areas like the canyons east of Elk Ridge; and other destinations for hunting, backpacking, canyoneering, whitewater rafting, and mountain biking, that are important to the increasing travel- and tourism-based economy in the region.

    <FP>WHEREAS, I find that the boundaries of the monument reserved by this proclamation represent the smallest area compatible with the protection of the objects of scientific or historic interest as required by the Antiquities Act; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to ensure the preservation, restoration, and protection of the objects of scientific and historic interest on the Bears Ears region, including the entire monument landscape, reserved within the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument, as established by this proclamation;</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above and in Proclamation 9558 that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Bears Ears National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands not currently reserved as part of a monument reservation and that are owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands consist of those lands reserved as part of the Bears Ears National Monument as of December 3, 2017, and the approximately 11,200 acres added by Proclamation 9681, encompassing approximately 1.36 million acres. As a result of the distribution of the objects across the Bears Ears landscape, and additionally and independently, because the landscape itself is an object in need of protection, the boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest identified above and in Proclamation 9558.</FP>
    <FP>All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws or laws applicable to the United States Forest Service (USFS), from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing, other than by exchange that furthers the protective purposes of the monument.</FP>
    <FP>This proclamation is subject to valid existing rights. If the Federal Government subsequently acquires any lands or interests in lands not currently owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests in lands shall be part of the monument, upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior (Secretaries) shall manage the monument through the USFS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), respectively, in accordance with the terms, conditions, and management direction provided by this proclamation and, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, those provided by Proclamation 9558, the latter of which are incorporated herein by reference. The USFS shall 
        <PRTPAGE P="249"/>
        manage that portion of the monument within the boundaries of the National Forest System (NFS), and the BLM shall manage the remainder of the monument. The lands administered by the USFS shall be managed as part of the Manti-La Sal National Forest. The lands administered by the BLM shall be managed as a unit of the National Landscape Conservation System. To the extent any provision of Proclamation 9681 is inconsistent with this proclamation or Proclamation 9558, the terms of this proclamation and Proclamation 9558 shall govern. To further the orderly management of monument lands, the monument will be jointly managed as a single unit consisting of the entire 1.36 million-acre monument.
    </FP>
    <FP>For purposes of protecting and restoring the objects identified above and in Proclamation 9558, the Secretaries shall jointly prepare and maintain a new management plan for the entire monument and shall promulgate such regulations for its management as they deem appropriate. The Secretaries, through the USFS and BLM, shall consult with other Federal land management agencies or agency components in the local area, including the National Park Service, in developing the management plan. In promulgating any management rules and regulations governing the NFS lands within the monument and developing the management plan, the Secretary of Agriculture, through the USFS, shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior, through the BLM. The Secretaries shall provide for maximum public involvement in the development of that plan, including consultation with federally recognized Tribes and State and local governments. In the development and implementation of the management plan, the Secretaries shall maximize opportunities, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, for shared resources, operational efficiency, and cooperation.</FP>
    <FP>In recognition of the importance of knowledge of Tribal Nations about these lands and objects and participation in the care and management of the objects identified above, and to ensure that management decisions affecting the monument reflect expertise and traditional and historical knowledge of Tribal Nations, a Bears Ears Commission (Commission) is reestablished in accordance with the terms, conditions, and obligations set forth in Proclamation 9558 to provide guidance and recommendations on the development and implementation of management plans and on management of the entire monument.</FP>
    <FP>To further the protective purposes of the monument, the Secretary of the Interior shall explore entering into a memorandum of understanding with the State of Utah that would set forth terms, pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, for an exchange of land owned by the State of Utah and administered by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration within the boundary of the monument for land of approximately equal value managed by the BLM outside the boundary of the monument. Consolidation of lands within the monument boundary through exchange in this manner provides for the orderly management of public lands and is in the public interest.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Secretaries shall manage livestock grazing as authorized under existing permits or leases, and subject to appropriate terms and conditions in accordance with existing laws and regulations, consistent with the care and management of the objects identified above and in Proclamation 9558.

    <PROC>Proclamation 10286 of October 8, 2021</PROC>
    <EAR>Proc. 10286</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Grand Staircase-Escalante National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>President Clinton's designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Proclamation 6920 of September 18, 1996, was a watershed moment for conservation in the United States. Proclamation 6920 represents the first time a President designated a national monument under the Antiquities Act to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management, signaling the dawn of the modern era of Antiquities Act protection and a reawakening of conservation efforts on public lands in the West.</FP>
    <FP>Proclamation 6920 describes the rich mosaic of objects of historic and scientific interest across Grand Staircase-Escalante. Proclamation 6920 details the monument's varied geology, from the cliffs of the Grand Staircase in the west, to the fossil-rich formations in the Kaiparowits Plateau that demonstrate billions of years of geology infused with world-class paleontological sites, to the badlands of the Burning Hills in the center, to the intricate and complex system of canyons in the Escalante region in the east. The proclamation goes on to describe the area's rich human history, spanning from the indigenous people and cultures who made this area home to Anglo-American explorers and early Latter-day Saint pioneers. The proclamation further identifies outstanding biological resources, describing the monument as “in the heart of perhaps the richest floristic region in the Intermountain West,” spanning five life zones and supporting diverse, rare, and endemic populations of plants and a diversity of animals, as well as unusual and diverse soils that support communities of mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria. In addition, the proclamation describes the vast opportunities for additional scientific research and discovery within the monument. Grand Staircase-Escalante has become the focus of a multi-disciplinary study of its large landscape for the benefit of current and future generations.</FP>
    <FP>After the monument was established, the Congress adjusted the boundaries or ratified the acquisition of additional lands within the monument on three separate occasions, in some cases adding lands, in other cases subtracting lands. When the Congress had completed its fine-tuning, it had increased the monument's reservation by more than 180,000 acres, bringing the total Federal lands within the monument boundaries to approximately 1.87 million acres.</FP>

        Remarkably, given its size, in the 25 years since its designation, Grand Staircase-Escalante has fulfilled the vision of an outdoor laboratory with great potential for diverse and significant scientific discoveries. During this period, hundreds of scientific studies and projects have been conducted within the monument, including investigating how the monument's geology provides insight into the hydrology of Mars; discovering many previously unknown species of dinosaurs, some of which have become household names; unearthing some of the oldest marsupial fossils ever identified; conducting extensive inventories of invertebrates, including the identification of more than 600 species of bees, some of which likely exist nowhere else on Earth; performing hydrologic research in the Escalante River and 
        <PRTPAGE P="253"/>
        Deer Creek; studying and restoring habitat for amphibians, mammals, and bird species, including the reintroduction of bighorn sheep and pronghorn to their native range; completing rangeland science assessments, including a complete Level III soils survey; carrying out widespread archaeological surveys that have documented important sites and rock writings; and implementing social science projects related to visitor experiences and impacts. New scientific discoveries are likely just around the corner; for example, scientists have collected thousands of specimens of invertebrates from the monument that await further study and are expected to yield new species that are endemic to the monument. Scientists have utilized every corner of the monument in their efforts to better understand our environment, our history, our planet's past, and our place in the universe.

    <FP>On December 4, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Proclamation 9682 to reduce the monument by over 860,000 acres. Proclamation 9682 removes protection from objects of historic and scientific interest across the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape, including some resources Proclamation 6920 specifically identifies for protection. Multiple parties challenged Proclamation 9682 in Federal court, asserting that it exceeded the President's authority under the Antiquities Act.</FP>
    <FP>Restoring the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to its size and boundaries as they existed prior to December 4, 2017, will ensure that this exceptional and inimitable landscape filled with an unparalleled diversity of resources will be properly protected and will continue to provide the living laboratory that has produced so many dramatic discoveries in the first quarter century of its existence. Given the unique nature of the objects identified across the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape, the threat of damage and destruction to those objects, and the current inadequate protection they are afforded, a reservation of this size is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest named in this proclamation and Proclamation 6920.</FP>
    <FP>The entire Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape—stretching from Skutumpah Terrace and the escarpments of the Grand Staircase in the west, Nipple Bench, Smoky Mountain, the Burning Hills, Grand Bench, the East and West Clark Benches, and Buckskin Mountain in the south, the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail that runs through the Escalante Desert, Upper Escalante Canyons, and Circle Cliffs in the northeast, and Alvey Wash and the Blues in the north—is an object of historic and scientific interest requiring protection under the Antiquities Act. There are innumerable objects of historic or scientific interest within this extraordinary landscape. Some of the objects are also sacred to Tribal Nations, rare, fragile, or vulnerable to vandalism and theft, or are dangerous to visit and, therefore, revealing their specific names and locations could pose a danger to the objects or the public.</FP>
    <FP>
        High, rugged, and remote, the vast and austere Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape is characterized by bold plateaus and multihued cliffs that run for distances that defy human perspective. It is also home to world-famous slot canyons that are so deep and narrow that sunlight almost never penetrates their ultimate depths, and pools of numbingly cold water remain throughout the hottest months. Despite being the last place in the contiguous United States to be mapped and remaining a remote and primitive landscape to this day, the Grand Staircase-Escalante area has a long and 
        <PRTPAGE P="254"/>
        dignified human history. The landscape teems with evidence of the efforts expended by both indigenous people and early Anglo pioneers to carve existences into an arid and unforgiving region. The Grand Staircase-Escalante region retains the frontier character of the American West, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience a remote landscape rich with opportunities for adventure and self-discovery. It is unique and rare in today's world to encounter a place where one can wander and ponder undisturbed, and explore and discover at one's own pace. It also serves as an outdoor laboratory on the frontier of scientific research that continues to regularly reveal important insights into our planet and our past.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape is a geologic treasure of clearly exposed stratigraphy and structures. The sedimentary rock layers are relatively undeformed and unobscured by vegetation, offering a clear view to understanding the Earth's geological development. Owing in large part to the exposure of so many formations, the landscape is one of the world's great paleontological laboratories. From remarkable specimens of petrified wood, to the most continuous record of Late Cretaceous life, to the first evidence that tyrannosaurs hunted in packs, to marble-like iron oxide concretions found in Navajo Sandstone that provide insight into Martian geology, the ongoing discoveries on the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape continue to make invaluable contributions to our understanding of the planet's past. Despite the abundance of paleontological discoveries that have occurred on the landscape, and the wealth of information they have provided about the entire Mesozoic Era, it is likely that we have thus far uncovered only a fragment of Grand Staircase-Escalante's paleontological story.</FP>
    <FP>Rich in human history, the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape abounds in evidence of habitation by the Ancestral Pueblo and Fremont cultures. Tribal Nations, including the Hopi Tribe, the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians, the Navajo Nation, the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe of Arizona, the Pueblo of Acoma, the Pueblo of San Felipe, the Pueblo of Tesuque, and the Pueblo of Zuni, have ancestral, cultural, or historical ties to this area and continue to use the area to this day. The Southern Paiute people in particular hold these lands sacred as they make up a portion of their traditional homeland. The landscape has also played an important role in European settlement of the American West. In 1776, the Dominguez-Escalante expedition may have passed through the region, and subsequent travelers on the Armijo Route of the Old Spanish Trail journeyed up the Paria River, through Cottonwood Canyon and the Cockscomb, and to the west through Kimball Valley and along parts of Telegraph Flat below the Vermillion Cliffs. The John Wesley Powell expedition created some of the earliest maps of the area in 1872, and later that decade, Latter-day Saint pioneers literally etched portions of the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail across the desert in their efforts to settle southern Utah.</FP>
    <FP>
        The landscape is also an outstanding biological resource. As a result of the blending of warm and cold desert flora and the high number of endemic species, the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape, which contains 50 percent of Utah's rare flora and 125 species of plants that occur only in Utah or on the Colorado Plateau, is one of the most floristically rich regions in 
        <PRTPAGE P="255"/>
        the Intermountain West. An abundance of unique, isolated plant communities can be found, such as hanging gardens, tinajas, and rock crevice, canyon bottom, and dunal pocket communities. Large expanses of various exposed geologic strata, each with unique physical and chemical characteristics, have resulted in a spectacular array of unusual and diverse soils, including desert pavement and biological soil crusts, which support a wide range of vegetative communities, such as relict plant communities that have existed since the Pleistocene, and a multitude of endemic plants and pollinators. For example, lands within the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape contain an astounding biodiversity of bees due, in large part, to the substantial elevational gradient, diversity of habitats, and abundance of flowering plants. The area is home to hundreds of bee species, including dozens of species that are believed to be unique to this landscape. Many of the species found in the Grand Staircase-Escalante region are highly localized, with small populations occurring in only a few locations or near certain flowering plants. Wildlife also flourishes; from mountain lion, bear, pronghorn, and desert bighorn sheep, to hundreds of species of birds, the landscape's location and the great variation in its elevation and topography have created a unique environment where suitable habitat exists for species associated with multiple eco-regions.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Grand Staircase-Escalante's large, isolated, and, at times, impenetrable landscape is one of the most naturally dark outdoor spaces left in America, providing views of the cosmos that are nearly unrivaled in the contiguous United States, and an opportunity for visitors to encounter a landscape at night, undisturbed by electric lights, in the same way people have experienced the West for most of America's history. According to recent research, over 90 percent of the landscape, or nearly 1.7 million acres, contains pristine night skies, meaning that observers would see no indication of artificial skyglow anywhere in the night sky. Only natural sources of light are visible to the human eye, such as starlight, airglow, aurora, and zodiacal light. Comparatively, less than one third of the land area of the United States regularly experiences this degree of natural darkness, and most of that land is located in Alaska. The Grand Staircase-Escalante area also provides a remarkable natural soundscape with infrequent human-caused sounds. From popular recreational destinations to remote, isolated locations, acoustic baseline research has found that some of the quietest conditions found in protected areas across the United States can be found in the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape.</FP>
    <FP>The Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape is akin to a nesting doll of objects of historic and scientific interest. The landscape as a whole is an important object that provides context for each of its constituent parts. Within the whole are distinct and unique areas, which are themselves objects qualifying for protection. In turn, each of those areas contain innumerable individual fossils, archaeological sites, rare species, and other objects that are independently of historic or scientific interest and require protection under the Antiquities Act.</FP>

        Located in the northeast corner of the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape adjacent to Capitol Reef National Park is the Circle Cliffs area, which is dominated by a northwest-trending sandstone anticline and dramatic red sandstone cliffs. The area also encompasses several sky islands, including Studhorse Peaks, Colt Mesa, and Deer Point, the latter of which provides exquisite views of Waterpocket Fold—a stunning fold in the area's geologic 
        <PRTPAGE P="256"/>
        layers that is the central feature of Capitol Reef National Park. The ecologically intact region provides important winter habitat for elk and contains a significant number of cultural sites used by Ancestral Pueblos and the Fremont. Specimens of petrified wood can be found across the Circle Cliffs area, including in the well-known Wolverine Petrified Wood Area, which includes some largely intact logs nearly 100 feet in length. Additionally, the Circle Cliffs landscape is rich in paleontological resources. The area, with geology dating back to the Triassic and Permian Periods, contains at least 45 known paleontological sites, including one in which a nearly complete articulated skeleton of 
        <E T="03">Poposaurus</E>
        —a rare bipedal crocodilian from the Late Triassic Period—was found. The Circle Cliffs landscape also contains portions of the Burr Trail, a route originally blazed by stockman John Atlantic Burr that is now a Utah Scenic Backway offering remarkable views of the Waterpocket Fold, the Henry Mountains, and the Boulder Mountain area of the Aquarius Plateau.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        West of the Circle Cliffs and bisected by the Escalante River is the awe-inspiring Upper Escalante Canyons landscape. In this region, vivid geological features are laid bare in narrow, serpentine canyons, where erosion has exposed rolling expanses of petrified dunes and rock striations in shades of red, salmon, white, buff, and rust. The area's resources are almost too numerous to name. There are natural bridges and arches, such as Maverick Natural Bridge and Phipps Arch, the 130-foot tall Escalante Natural Bridge, and Bowington Arch; a large and unusual circular erosional sandstone formation that has sparked the public's imagination, as evidenced by its many names, including the Cosmic Navel; and several world-class slot canyons that draw adventurers from the world over, such as the Dry Fork of Coyote Gulch, Brimstone Canyon, Peek-a-boo Canyon, Spooky Gulch, Zebra and Tunnel Slot Canyons, and the Egypt Slots. The Escalante Canyons landscape also contains a high density of Fremont prehistoric sites, such as pithouses, villages, and storage cysts. The area's many canyons contain a world-class density and variety of Fremont, Ancestral Pueblo, and Southern Paiute rock writings, including a panel that is particularly meaningful to Tribal Nations with ancestral and historical ties to the area and another panel containing polychromatic depictions of long, linear figures that may date back to the Archaic period. The Escalante Canyons landscape also contains many inscriptions left by early settlers of European descent and significant historic sites telling tales of the region's more recent past, such as the Boulder Mail Trail, which was used to ferry mail between the small desert outpost towns of Escalante and Boulder beginning in 1902. The Boulder Mail Trail intersects incredibly scenic canyons that empty into the Escalante River. The narrow sandstone walls of Sand Creek shade a perennial stream that meanders through cool pools and supports riparian habitat and hanging gardens. Perennial flows are also found in Death Hollow, a stunning canyon chiseled into yellow and white Navajo Sandstone that is narrow and extraordinarily deep in its upper reaches before transitioning near the Boulder Mail Trail into a wider canyon dotted with ponderosa pine and riparian habitat. As a result of the abundance of water in tributaries of the Escalante River, as well as various seeps and springs, the Escalante Canyons area is dotted with hanging gardens, tinajas, and riparian vegetation that provide oases of sorts in an otherwise arid environment. The area is distilled to its essence in Calf Creek Canyon, the home of towering Navajo Sandstone cliffs, lush vegetation, cultural sites, and a perennial stream with two waterfalls: a slender 88-foot plunge in the upper part 
        <PRTPAGE P="257"/>
        of the canyon, and a 126-foot cascade farther downstream that is one of the more elegant waterfalls in the entire Southwest. The upper part of the watershed is strewn with black basalt boulders and expanses of iron concretion sheets.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        To the southeast of the Upper Escalante Canyons, adjacent to Capitol Reef National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, is a region with a rich pioneer history that functions as a gateway to the many slot canyons and arches near the Escalante River. Traversing the area is the historically significant Hole-in-the-Rock Road, which generally follows the route that Latter-day Saint pioneers constructed between 1879 and 1880 when crossing southern Utah to establish a wagon route between Escalante and southeast Utah settlements. Today, the road provides access to many of the landscape's resources, including Devil's Garden, an area with hoodoos, colorful rock formations, and unique sandstone arches like the impressively delicate Metate Arch; the small but attractive Little Jumbo Arch; the widely photographed Sunrise and Sunset arches; and Chimney Rock, a remote, lonely sandstone pillar that seems to defy its otherwise flat surroundings. This area is also the location of Dance Hall Rock, an important landmark where Latter-day Saint pioneers camped and held meetings and dances when constructing the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail. These uncompromising desert lands are home to high concentrations of rare species of bees with fascinating adaptations to their local environment, such as 
        <E T="03">Diadasia</E>
         bees, which build nests in the hard desert soil that feature a clay chimney on top, an architectural design that has, thus far, stumped scientists trying to understand its utility. Consisting of rock primarily from the Jurassic Period, there are many paleontological sites in this region. Among those, the sprawling Twentymile Wash Dinosaur Megatrackway consists of more than several hundred individual dinosaur tracks and what some scientists believe is a rare, mid-line tail-drag impression left in the Escalante Member of the Entrada Formation by a sauropod, or long-necked dinosaur.
    </FP>
    <FP>At the center of the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape is the Kaiparowits Plateau, containing roughly 1,600 square miles of sedimentary rock that towers over the surrounding area. The plateau is bordered on the east side by the Straight Cliffs, which stretch from near the beginning of the Escalante River to Fiftymile Mountain, and on the west by the East Kaibab Monocline, better known as the Cockscomb. The area is made up of steep-walled canyons, escarpments, towers, arches, and a series of benches that ascend from the southern border of the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape. The Cockscomb is formed by parallel ridges with an intersecting steep v-shaped trough, and flatirons, small monoliths, and other colorful formations along the western ridge. The plateau has evidence of thousands of years of human habitation with sites attributed to many prehistoric cultures in southern Utah. Bighorn sheep and pronghorn have historically roamed the Kaiparowits Plateau—as evidenced by the area's petroglyph and pictograph panels—and reproducing populations have been reintroduced in recent years. The area is also home to a small population of chuckwalla and a population of desert night lizard, a species rarely seen in Utah.</FP>
    <FP>
        The stratified geology of the Kaiparowits Plateau exposes fossils and other indicia of hundreds of millions of years of our planet's history, the only evidence in our hemisphere of mammals from the Cenomanian through Santonian ages and one of the world's best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life. To date, many thousands of fossil sites 
        <PRTPAGE P="258"/>
        have been documented on the plateau, including evidence of at least 15 previously unknown species of dinosaur. Fossils are preserved in stunning detail rarely seen in North America, including traces of soft tissue and the impressions of skin, beaks, and claws. The plateau contains a diverse assemblage of Campanian fauna, including a remarkable record of vertebrate species that include many new taxa and new temporal and geographic occurrences, thereby making the Kaiparowits Plateau an important scientific resource providing insight to the Late Cretaceous biosphere.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        The Kaiparowits Plateau comprises multiple geological formations. The Kaiparowits and Wahweap Formations contain diverse and unique fossil evidence of ancient fauna and flora, including pterosaurs, frogs, salamanders, and snakes, that are fundamentally different from discoveries in other parts of North America. The Kaiparowits Formation has produced many ancient vertebrate taxa that are entirely new to science, including a vast array of horned dinosaurs, such as the 
        <E T="03">Nasutoceratops</E>
        , 
        <E T="03">Kosmoceratops</E>
        , and 
        <E T="03">Utahceratops</E>
        , a new species of 
        <E T="03">Gryposaurus</E>
         possessing a more robust skull, a new raptor, and the tyrannosaurid 
        <E T="03">Teratophoneus</E>
        . It has also produced evidence of a potentially new crested duck-billed dinosaur and incredibly diverse vegetative communities with previously undescribed fossil trees and aquatic plants. In 2018, researchers recovered the 
        <E T="03">Akainacephalus</E>
        , which is the most complete ankylosaur ever recovered in the southwestern United States. Exploration of the Wahweap Formation, while still in early stages, has led to striking Mesozoic Era discoveries, including the horned dinosaur 
        <E T="03">Diabloceratops</E>
         and the tyrannosaurid 
        <E T="03">Lythronax</E>
        . Similarly, the Dakota Formation contains some of the earliest evidence of mammals in the fossil record, and the Tropic Shale Formation includes important marine reptiles such as five species of plesiosaur and North America's oldest mosasaur. There are at least two mass mortality sites on the Kaiparowits Plateau, including the Rainbows and Unicorns site, which preserves the relatively complete remains of at least four tyrannosaurs ranging in age from juvenile to large adult, indicating that tyrannosaurs may have been social hunters and engaged in extended parental care, and Uncle Charley's Bonebed, which produced the fossilized remains of extinct tortoises, many of which had soft tissue preservation of skin and claws, and one of which even had a clutch of eggs preserved in its carapace. In addition, petrified wood from the Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous Periods is found in the Morrison, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits Formations. The plateau also has an expansive exposure of a unique deposit of fossil oyster beds up to six feet thick from the Cretaceous Period, along with other marine mollusk shells.

        The eastern portion of the Kaiparowits Plateau is dominated by Fiftymile Mountain and Fiftymile Bench. The upper elevations of these bench lands contain rich and varied ecosystems that include pinyon and juniper woodlands, ponderosa pine forests, and aspen groves. The area is dissected by a labyrinth of picturesque canyons, many of which contain important riparian ecosystems. The Fiftymile Mountain area has a high density of archaeological sites, including masonry structures, which have architectural styles suggesting that the Virgin Branch and Kayenta Branch of Ancestral Pueblos and the Fremont culture converged in the area. There are also sites considered sacred to several Tribal Nations with historical or ancestral ties to the Grand Staircase-Escalante region. This area further contains evidence of 
        <PRTPAGE P="259"/>
        early pioneers who tried to scratch out a life on the sparse landscape, including historic cabins, fences, and stock trails. The sagebrush steppe ecosystem of Fiftymile Bench provides views of Window Wind Arch and striking vistas of the skyscraper-like escarpment that is the eastern face of the Straight Cliffs. The Straight Cliffs Formation, which is particularly exposed in this part of southern Utah, is rich with fossil resources containing evidence of primitive mammals, as well as straight cone cephalopods, ammonites, gastropods, pelecypods, and Cretaceous shark teeth. The Straight Cliffs also contain many clusters of balanced or pedestal rocks, known as hoodoos. Sooner Rocks, at the base of the Straight Cliffs, provides outstanding examples of the geologic feature known as “mega-potholes” that are more often found in some of the sandstone formations in and around Glen Canyon.
    </FP>
    <FP>Grand Bench lies on the southeastern border of the Kaiparowits Plateau between the Burning Hills to the west and Fiftymile Mountain to the east. The sparse road network in Grand Bench makes it one of the most remote locations in the Grand Staircase-Escalante, with largely unspoiled and unimpeded views of the night sky. The Grand Bench area is also home to the mostly freestanding Woolsey Arch, as well as many recorded paleontology sites found in its Cretaceous and Jurassic Period rocks, including petrified wood and important fossils.</FP>
    <FP>The Smoky Mountain area just west of Grand Bench on the Kaiparowits Plateau provides a striking scene. The steep and rugged hilltops of the Burning Hills have been scorched red by naturally occurring underground coal fires that have been smoldering for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Similarly, Smoky Mountain is dotted with natural chimneys that release hot smoke and sulfuric gasses from the coal fires below. Despite the hostile environment, this area is home to a number of rare and endemic plant species, including Atwood evening primrose and Smoky Mountain globemallow, as well as a thriving herd of desert bighorn sheep and nesting areas for a high density of raptors.</FP>
    <FP>The lower benches of the Kaiparowits Plateau, including John Henry Bench, Tibbet Bench, Nipple Bench, and Jack Riggs Bench, lie to the west of Smoky Mountain and provide important habitat for big game, including desert bighorn sheep and pronghorn, and sweeping views to the south. The Cretaceous Wahweap Formation runs through the area and has been the site of many important fossil finds, including turtle shells, dinosaurs, and crocodile teeth. Just west of Nipple Bench are the Wahweap Hoodoos, ghostly white formations with brown capstones that can appear to float in the right conditions.</FP>
    <FP>
        Alvey Wash is situated in the northern part of the Kaiparowits Plateau, close to the Straight Cliffs, and north of Death Ridge. In addition to providing access to the interior of the Kaiparowits Plateau, the Alvey Wash area contains geologic objects of historic and scientific interest, including various arches and portions of the Smoky Mountain Road State Scenic Backway, a remote, unpaved route that offers unparalleled views of Lake Powell and the Kaiparowits Plateau. The region's fossil-rich Cretaceous rocks contain more than a hundred known recorded paleontological sites. Alvey Wash, which likely acted as an important travel route between the 
        <PRTPAGE P="260"/>
        Escalante River and the top of the Kaiparowits Plateau, also contains several important Fremont and Ancestral Pueblo sites, including rock writings, rock shelters, cliffside storage structures, and pithouses.
    </FP>
    <FP>In the northern part of the landscape, east of the towns of Tropic and Cannonville, are the Blues, an area named for the blue-grey sandstone that provides a striking contrast against the forested uplands and the pink and white cliffs of Powell Point towering in the background. The velvety gray slopes of these shale badlands include exposures of the Kaiparowits Formation that are unique on the Colorado Plateau. Representing rapid accumulation of sediment during the Late Cretaceous Period, the stratigraphy has facilitated the discovery of a diversity of fossils, including early mammals, lizards, dinosaurs, crocodilians, turtles, mollusks, and some fossils found nowhere else on Earth, including one of the largest oviraptors ever discovered. This area may also provide habitat for many raptor species, including Swainson's hawks, golden eagles, and peregrine falcons.</FP>
    <FP>South of the Blues, the Butler Valley area provides jaw-dropping views of multi-colored sandstone cliffs to the north and contains important microvertebrate fossil localities in the Smoky Hollow Member of the Straight Cliffs Formation found near the upper reaches of Wiggler Wash. Also nearby is Grosvenor Arch, a rare double arch with sandstone buttresses that soars 150 feet in the air, as well as the tight canyons of Butler Valley and Round Valley Draw.</FP>
    <FP>To the west of the Cockscomb lies the Hackberry Canyon area, with a deep gorge containing towering Wingate Sandstone cliffs and impressive narrows, and Yellow Rock, a smooth-sided dome that obtains its unique appearance from evaporated pools of water and the presence of limonite in its swirling Navajo Sandstone. With limited vegetation, Yellow Rock provides a commanding view of Hackberry Canyon to the north, the Paria River to the west, and the Cockscomb to the east. The area's high scenic quality is further enhanced by a number of towering arches, including Sam Pollock Arch, which spans 70 feet in a tributary of Hackberry Canyon. The Hackberry Canyon area contains Virgin Branch of Ancestral Pueblo sites, such as rock shelters, pithouses, lithic scatters, and masonry structures, as well as rock writings that can be found in side canyons. Hackberry Canyon also contains evidence of later Anglo habitation, including Watson Cabin, a one-room log cabin with a fieldstone chimney that was built in the early 1890s and is one of the few standing pioneer structures in the region.</FP>
    <FP>
        To the west of the Kaiparowits Plateau, the Upper Paria River complex is a highly scenic and colorful maze of canyons, arches, and “hydrothermal-collapse” pipes and dikes that expose the multihued Carmel and Entrada Formations. The area is home to many perennial streams, the Paria River, and hundreds of acres of riparian vegetation, all of which support a particularly rich diversity of terrestrial vertebrate and avian species. Flowing continuously for most of the year thanks to water from the higher elevations in the north and west, the area's perennial streams have left the area dissected with canyons that eventually drain into the Paria River. As the flow increases, the Paria River cuts its way through a series of benches and cliffs that form a portion of the Grand Staircase as it meanders towards its confluence with the Colorado River near Lee's Ferry. For example, there is the spring-fed Willis Creek, which flows year-round through a moderately deep gorge that contains several sections of elegant narrows. Other 
        <PRTPAGE P="261"/>
        nearby canyons, although dry most of the year, are subject to extreme erosional events from passing storms, such as Lick Wash, a deep canyon enclosed by horizontally striated white sandstone walls that are hundreds of feet high, and Bull Valley Gorge, an impressively deep and narrow canyon cut through Navajo Sandstone containing a variety of rock formations and colors. The Upper Paria River complex contains paleontological sites found in strata from the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Paria River corridor is also the site of the Paria ghost town, the only historic townsite in the monument. First settled by Latter-day Saint pioneers in 1865 as a farming community, the town was largely abandoned after a series of floods in the late 1800s, save for a post office, which served the area for many years.
    </FP>
    <FP>After the Paria River crosses the Cockscomb and enters Cottonwood Canyon, it feeds a rich riparian area that provides important habitat for the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. Cottonwood Canyon and the nearby Rimrocks area are home to a number of rare plants, such as the Tropic goldeneye and Atwood's pretty phacelia. This area, down to West Clark Bench, is also characterized by high ecological system diversity and is home to a number of rare bee species as well as a number of hot desert endemic species of bees in the northernmost known extent of their range. The Rimrocks area is home to striking geological formations known as the Toadstool Hoodoos, fascinating features composed of Dakota Sandstone boulders perched precariously atop softer and eroded Entrada Sandstone, and a narrow slot canyon that contains rock writings. Further east, other geological formations include the White Rocks, and to the south, the area around the East and West Clark Benches forms a barren and austere landscape that exposes Jurassic and Cretaceous Period rocks rich in paleontological resources.</FP>
    <FP>
        On the west side of the landscape is the Grand Staircase, a series of intensely colorful cliffs and plateaus that connect Bryce Canyon to the Grand Canyon. The Grey Cliffs are composed of soft Cretaceous shale and sandstone in subdued shades of gray, brown, and yellow that were deposited approximately 130 million years ago. The White Cliffs are high white or yellow cliffs of Navajo Sandstone that consistently reach heights of more than 1,000 feet. The area is home to rare and endemic bee species, particularly near Timber Mountain. The area also contains a number of relict plant communities on the sky islands of No Man's Mesa and Little No Man's Mesa, whose steep walls have guarded such communities for thousands of years, providing a living window into the past. Further south, the eponymous Vermilion Cliffs, once the shoreline for the ancient Lake Dixie, contain fossilized fish, dinosaurs, and early reptiles, as well as multiple tracksites. The Flag Point tracksite provides an enduring testament to humans' fascination with the traces of epochs past. The site contains a series of theropod tracks leading right to the cliff edge and, nearby, pictographs of the tracks that were likely left by ancient indigenous peoples living in nearby communities. The Grand Staircase area is also replete with evidence of thousands of years of human habitation. Pre-historic projectile points and hunter-gatherer residential pit structures are found in the higher elevations, whereas evidence of some of the earliest corn-related agriculture in the Southwest, developed by the Virgin Branch of Ancestral Pueblos, as well as evidence of the Southern Paiute people, who identify this area as part of their ancestral homeland, are found in the lower elevations. This 
        <PRTPAGE P="262"/>
        area also contains a number of other unusual and important resources, including a high density of petrified wood and rare and endemic plant species, such as the Higgins spring parsley and Kane breadroot.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Buckskin Mountain area, located southeast of the Vermilion Cliffs and west of the Cockscomb, is a unique lithological area, rich in rocks from the Triassic Period and late Paleozoic Era. It also provides winter range for the renowned Paunsaugunt mule deer herd and is the location of the Eagle Sink, a stunning sinkhole where the surrounding limestone collapsed to create an enormous 160-foot depression. The area also contains many Ancestral Pueblo cultural sites and provides access to the primary trailheads used to access Buckskin Gulch—the longest slot canyon in the United States, with walls ascending up to 400 feet—located in the adjacent Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness.</FP>
    <FP>Protection of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, and historic legacy and maintain its diverse array of natural and scientific resources, ensuring that the prehistoric, historic, and scientific values of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. Reservation of these lands will preserve the living laboratory within the monument boundaries that will facilitate significant scientific discoveries for years to come. The area contains numerous objects of historic and scientific interest, and it provides world-class outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock climbing, hunting, hiking, backpacking, canyoneering, river running, mountain biking, and horseback riding, that support a travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic opportunity for the region.</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, Proclamation 6920 of September 18, 1996, designated the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in the State of Utah and reserved approximately 1.7 million acres of Federal lands as the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of objects of historic and scientific interest; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, on three separate occasions the Congress adjusted the boundaries of the monument—the Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998, Public Law 105-335, 112 Stat. 3139; title II of Public Law 105-355, 112 Stat. 3247, 3252 (1998); and section 2604 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Public Law 111-11, 123 Stat. 991, 1120—ultimately increasing the Federal lands reserved for the monument by more than 180,000 acres.</FP>
    <FP>
        WHEREAS, Proclamation 9682 of December 4, 2017, modifies the management direction of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and excludes nearly half of the lands reserved in Proclamation 6920, which include lands containing objects of historic and scientific interest that Proclamation 6920 identifies as needing protection, such as portions of Circle Cliffs and Waterpocket Fold; and
        <PRTPAGE P="263"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>
        WHEREAS, December 4, 2017, was the first time that a President asserted that the Antiquities Act included the authority to reduce the boundaries of a national monument or remove objects from protection under the Antiquities Act since the 1976 passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq</E>
        .); and
    </FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, I find that each of the historic and scientific resources identified above and in Proclamation 6920 are objects of historic or scientific interest in need of protection under 54 U.S.C. 320301; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, I find that the unique nature of the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape, and the collection of objects and resources therein, make the entire landscape within the boundaries reserved by this proclamation an object of historic and scientific interest in need of protection under 54 U.S.C. 320301; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, I find that there are threats to the objects identified in this proclamation and Proclamation 6920; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, I find, in the absence of a reservation under the Antiquities Act, the objects identified in this proclamation and in Proclamation 6920 are not adequately protected by otherwise applicable law or administrative designations because neither provide the Department of the Interior with the specific mandate to ensure proper care and management of the objects, nor do they withdraw the lands from the operation of the public land, mining, and mineral leasing laws, and so a national monument reservation is necessary to protect the objects of historic and scientific interest in the Grand Staircase-Escalante region for current and future generations; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, I find that the boundaries of the monument reserved by this proclamation represent the smallest area compatible with the protection of the objects of historic or scientific interest as required by the Antiquities Act; and</FP>
    <FP>WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to ensure the preservation, restoration, and protection of the objects of historic or scientific interest on the Grand Staircase-Escalante lands, including the entire monument landscape, reserved within the boundaries established by this proclamation;</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above and in Proclamation 6920 that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as part thereof all lands and interests in lands not currently reserved as part of a monument reservation and that are owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands consist of those lands reserved as part of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument as of December 3, 2017, encompassing approximately 1.87 million acres. As a result of the distribution of the objects across the Grand Staircase-Escalante landscape, and additionally and independently, because the landscape itself is an object in need of protection, the boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area 
        <PRTPAGE P="264"/>
        compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest identified above and in Proclamation 6920.

    <EAR>Proc. 10287</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National MonumentBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On September 15, 2016, President Barack Obama issued Proclamation 9496 (Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument), which designated approximately 4,913 square miles of waters and submerged lands where the Atlantic Ocean meets the continental shelf as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. This designation represented the culmination of nearly a half-century of conservation efforts to preserve the vulnerable deep marine ecosystems of the Atlantic canyons and seamounts, which are widely known as natural laboratories for the long-term study of benthic ecology due to their rich biodiversity of important deep-sea corals, endangered whales, endangered and threatened sea turtles, other marine mammals, and numerous fish and invertebrate species.</FP>
    <FP>
        The monument is composed of two units, the Canyons Unit and the Seamounts Unit, each of which showcases unique geological features that anchor vulnerable ecological communities threatened by varied uses, climate change, and related impacts. As described by Proclamation 9496, the Canyons Unit includes three underwater canyons: Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia. The canyons' hard walls, which range from 200 meters to thousands of meters deep, provide important habitats for, and support the life cycles of, a diversity of ocean life, including sponges, corals, and other invertebrates; larger species such as squid, octopuses, skates, flounders, and crabs; and highly migratory oceanic species, including tuna, billfish, sharks, toothed whales (such as the endangered sperm whale), and many species of beaked whales. The larger Seamounts Unit is home to four extinct undersea volcanoes—Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus—that form a portion of an underwater chain of more than 30 extinct volcanoes that runs from the southern side of the Georges Bank to midway across the western Atlantic Ocean. These extinct volcanoes were formed as the Earth's crust passed over a stationary hot spot that pushed magma up through the seafloor, and many of them have flat tops that were created as ocean waves eroded the cooling magma. Geographically isolated from the continental platform and characterized by steep and complex submarine topography that interrupts existing ocean currents and provides a constant supply of plankton and nutrients, the seamounts are biological islands with various substrates that form ocean oases and act as incubators for new life. All four seamounts support highly diverse ecological communities, including many rare and endemic species that are new to science and are not known to live anywhere else on Earth. Together, the monument's submarine canyons and seamounts create the unique ecological conditions necessary to support one of the Atlantic Ocean's most biologically productive and important marine environments and one of science's greatest oceanic laboratories. Proclamation 9496 recognized the undersea canyons and seamounts, the deep-sea, pelagic, and other marine ecosystems they support, and the biodiversity they contain as objects of historic and scientific interest and dedicated the 
        <PRTPAGE P="268"/>
        Federal lands and waters within the monuments' boundaries to their protection.
    </FP>
    <FP>To provide for the proper care and management of the monument's objects of historic and scientific interest, Proclamation 9496 directed the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior (Secretaries) to prepare a joint management plan and promulgate implementing regulations, as appropriate. To the extent consistent with domestic and international law, Proclamation 9496 also directed the Secretaries to prohibit certain activities within the monument, including mineral exploration and development; the use of poisons, electrical charges, or explosives to collect or harvest monument resources; and drilling into, anchoring, dredging, or otherwise altering submerged lands. Proclamation 9496 also directed the Secretaries to prohibit all commercial fishing within the monument, but allowed the Secretaries to permit a 7-year phase-out for red crab and American lobster commercial fishing.</FP>
    <FP>Despite the monument's ecological importance, wealth of objects of historic and scientific interest, and potential for additional scientific discovery, President Donald Trump issued Proclamation 10049 (Modifying the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument) on June 5, 2020, to remove the restrictions on commercial fishing. Multiple parties challenged Proclamation 10049 in Federal court, asserting that it exceeded the President's authority under the Antiquities Act. Restoring the prohibition on commercial fishing will ensure that the unique, fragile, and largely pristine canyons and seamounts, and the dynamic ocean systems and marine life they support, identified in Proclamation 9496 as objects of historic or scientific interest requiring protection under the Antiquities Act, will be safeguarded and will continue to provide an important venue for scientific study and research.</FP>
    <FP>The Canyons Unit and Seamounts Unit each contain interconnected oceanographic, geologic, and biologic features that create a unique oceanic system that supports an abundant concentration of biodiversity. These features' close proximity to each other results in an interdependent whole that exceeds the sum of its constituent parts.</FP>
    <FP>
        In the case of the Canyons Unit, the monument boundary closely corresponds to a contiguous continental shelf break area around the heads of the three canyons, which extend seaward from features that have not yet fully taken on the distinctive canyon shape, to the walls and valleys of the canyons themselves, and out to the start of the outer shelf thousands of meters below. Within this transitional region, the walls of the three closely situated canyons combine with ocean currents, temperature gradients, eddies, and fronts to create significant and complex nutrient cycling and other processes that result in a biologically rich and distinct oceanic system. The Canyons Unit is sized to correspond to and protect these large-scale oceanic processes that provide the foundation for the distinct habitat that supports numerous objects of scientific interest. For example, the shallower depths of the canyons include ecologically significant and vulnerable habitat for tilefish, which function as ecosystem engineers by creating “pueblo” habitat at depths of 100 to 300 meters in the monument's canyons, which in turn supports a diversity of fish and invertebrate species. The Canyons Unit also supports a great abundance of marine mammals and other upper-
        <PRTPAGE P="269"/>
        trophic level predators attracted to the prey abundance fostered by the Canyons Unit's unique marine landscape. Due to the close proximity of the three canyons to one another, congregating marine mammals and pelagic fish species routinely transit the inter-canyon areas while foraging among the biologic abundance found there. This is an example of the important ecological linkages that connect the monument's various topographies, the surrounding shelf, and the water column above them, which necessitate protection of the entire interrelated system.
    </FP>
    <FP>In the case of the Seamounts Unit, the boundary encompasses the four seamounts and the areas between the edges of Bear and Retriever Seamounts on the north side, Bear and Mytilus Seamounts on the south side, and out to the boundary line of the Exclusive Economic Zone on the east side. These four seamounts, rising thousands of feet from the surrounding seafloor, are the only seamounts located within U.S. Atlantic waters. As with the Canyons Unit, the proximity of these important geologic features to each other influences the currents, upwelling, stratification, and mixing that make the species and habitat within the monument so diverse, abundant, and unique. The seamounts function as oases in the open ocean environment and feature distinct ecological communities as they grade down from the relatively shallow seamount peaks to the abyss below. They are critical to protecting the ecosystem linkages that transport nutrients to the surface through predator-prey interactions and temperature-driven upwelling, and transport organic carbon to deep-sea ecosystems (corals and benthic communities) through plankton and fecal detritus, downwelling materials, down-slope currents, and animal migration and mortality.</FP>
    <FP>The boundaries of the monument reflect the need to protect the canyons, seamounts, and the attendant deep-sea, pelagic, and other marine ecosystems, which are themselves objects of historic and scientific interest, as well as the complex geologic, oceanographic, and biologic characteristics in the Canyons Unit and Seamounts Unit. The monument ensures these vulnerable marine ecosystems are safeguarded and will remain the great ocean laboratories recognized in Proclamation 9496. The boundaries are closely hewn to prominent geologic objects that form the foundation of closely linked habitats, which support the monument's great abundance and diversity of life. The boundaries are scaled to avoid cascading negative effects from failing to protect parts of these complex and interconnected marine environments and their unique oceanographic processes. In order to ensure effective management and protection of the objects of historic and scientific interest, straight-line coordinates are used where possible to provide clear and enforceable demarcation of this open-ocean monument. For these reasons, Proclamation 9496 found that the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the monument's boundaries were the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest designated for protection.</FP>
    <FP>
        Commercial fishing activity has the potential to significantly degrade the monument's objects of historic and scientific interest. Bottom-contact fishing gear and fixed fishing gear (for example, traps, gillnets, and bottom and pelagic long-line gear) with buoys, submerged lines, and associated traps, mesh, or hooks, all pose threats to the canyons and seamounts, the ecosystem, and the deep-sea, pelagic, and other marine life they support, as well as the additional objects of historic and scientific interest contained

The prohibition on commercial fishing confers necessary, additional, and lasting protections for the objects of historic and scientific interest in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument for current and future generations.
    </FP>
    <FP>Protection of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts as a marine national monument preserves significant geological features, marine biota, and deep-sea, pelagic, and other marine ecosystems that the canyons and seamounts create and support as they interact with ocean currents, ensuring that the natural and scientific values of this area are maintained for the benefit of all Americans and for the discovery of new information about living marine resources for years to come.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Blind Americans Equality Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Thirty-one years ago, our Nation moved closer to fulfilling its foundational promise of equal dignity and opportunity for all with the enactment of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. This bipartisan legislation—which I proudly co-sponsored as a member of the United States Senate—has made a profound difference in the lives of blind Americans, paving the way for greater opportunity, self-sufficiency, independent living, and equitable participation in all aspects of life. On Blind Americans Equality Day, we recognize the rights, talents, and contributions of blind and visually impaired Americans who represent every segment of our diverse population.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to building on the foundation of the Americans with Disabilities Act by ensuring that blind and visually impaired Americans have equitable opportunities for employment and career advancement. That is why I signed Executive Orders to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility within the Federal workforce and to raise the minimum wage of Federal contractors to $15 an hour—orders which will directly impact our many Federal contractors who are blind and visually impaired. These actions will further enable Federal workers with disabilities to access reasonable accommodations and gain greater economic self-sufficiency while spurring the Federal Government to be a model employer in providing equitable, accessible, and inclusive work environments for employees with disabilities.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also providing funding opportunities across agencies to advance competitive integrated employment opportunities for disabled workers. And to provide much-needed financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic, my Administration recently awarded $20 million through the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program to assist blind entrepreneurs and provide opportunities for blind vendors to operate vending facilities on Federal property.</FP>
    <FP>Building an accessible, equitable Nation for all Americans is a key part of building back better, and for many families, fulfilling that commitment begins in America's classrooms. When we invest in education, we advance equity and opportunity for millions of students, including children who are blind and visually impaired. My American Rescue Plan has made over $3 billion available to help State educational agencies recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding is supporting special education, early intervention, and related services for children with disabilities and their families. While the American Rescue Plan increased the amount of the Federal Government's financial contribution to the education of children with disabilities, my Administration is also working with the Congress to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act—so that disabled students can receive an education that is tailored to their individual needs.</FP>
    <FP>
        This is about who we are as Americans—and these actions are helping us move our country closer to the fulfillment of our highest ideals of equity and opportunity for all. On Blind Americans Equality Day, we recommit 
        <PRTPAGE P="273"/>
        to ensuring freedom, equality, and opportunity for all blind and visually impaired Americans, whose contributions continue to make our Nation stronger.
    </FP>
    <FP>By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as amended), the Congress authorized October 15 of each year as “White Cane Safety Day,” which is recognized today as “Blind Americans Equality Day,” to honor the contributions of blind and visually impaired Americans.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2021, as Blind Americans Equality Day. I call upon all government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to mark this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Character Counts Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every day, each of us makes countless decisions that ultimately define our character and who we are as people. Life's daily choices may not always seem consequential, but they have tremendous potential to transform our communities, our country, and our world. Our words have the power to lift up or tear down, to inspire or discourage, and to comfort or torment. Our actions have the power to create or destroy, to heal or to hurt, and to unify or divide.</FP>
    <FP>As Americans, our individual character—the sum of qualities that defines who we are and how we treat one another—shapes the character of our Nation and shapes the world we leave for our children. Our character is defined and revealed by the choices we make over a lifetime and, in the case of our Nation, from generation to generation. As we celebrate National Character Counts Week, I encourage all Americans to examine and embody the highest ideals that define our Nation and that have helped us overcome our greatest challenges.</FP>
    <FP>I have long said that the story of America is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is a story of strength and resilience, courage and character. Today, our Nation faces tests like very few before—from fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing longstanding inequities and injustices, to confronting the ravages of climate change, and responding to threats to our very democracy. Despite these trials, it is the character of the American people—courageous, selfless, and community-minded—that is pulling us through. As we see in our first responders on the frontlines of the pandemic helping their communities with selfless compassion, in our service members bravely serving around the globe, in our scientists pursuing knowledge with integrity, in our firefighters combating wildfires, and in our teachers and parents and students adapting to new learning environments with patience and determination—Americans are meeting the moment by working to see that we overcome our challenges together.</FP>
    <FP>Character is also revealed by our choices. We must choose to uphold the dignity of all Americans by protecting their health and security, investing in their education and development, helping the needy and the vulnerable, and erasing the stain of hate and discrimination from our society. On this and so many other tasks, I firmly believe that the American people are up to the challenge.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 23, 2021, as National Character Counts Week. I encourage all Americans to set aside differences and join in efforts of service that contribute to their communities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Forest Products Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For thousands of years, humans have relied on forests for food, fuel, shelter, and medicine among other important uses. Today, forests support the livelihoods of people across the globe, providing jobs and an economic base for families and communities. In the United States, our forests are vital to our Nation, our people, and our economy. They provide wildlife habitat, clean air and water, and renewable materials and energy for the benefit of Americans. Forests also provide Americans countless opportunities for recreation and relaxation, and they remain vital for ceremonies and cultural practices long held by Tribal Nations. During National Forest Products Week, we celebrate the wealth of products and benefits our forests provide, and we recommit ourselves to wisely and sustainably stewarding them to meet our Nation's needs today and long into the future.</FP>
    <FP>While celebrating our forests, we must also acknowledge they are under duress. Climate change threatens our forests by increasing the severity and frequency of wildfires, droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures. My Administration is committed to confronting the climate crisis and the associated challenges facing our forests, including those stemming from biodiversity loss, extreme weather, and insect and disease outbreaks. That is why my Administration launched the “America the Beautiful” initiative with the goal of bringing Americans together to conserve at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030. This initiative elevates forest restoration as a way to create jobs while also reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires, restoring ecosystem function, and fighting the climate crisis. This ambitious goal will drive us forward to meet the urgent challenges we face in maintaining the health, diversity, and productivity of our forests.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our forests and the many ecosystem services and wood products they provide are key elements in securing an environmentally sustainable economy. My Administration will continue to advance community-driven conservation and restoration initiatives that will create good jobs—especially in low-income and rural communities—and generate economic growth. My Administration is also supporting business opportunities that advance forest conservation and create jobs by expanding markets for innovative forest products through Federal programs such as the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Wood Innovations and Community Wood grant programs. We are proposing investments in sustainable and innovative uses for wood waste materials to produce advanced biofuels, biochar, heat, and power—including through sustainable aviation fuels and other 
        <PRTPAGE P="276"/>
        sustainable biofuels. These programs have the potential to support increased connections between the health of our forests, economic opportunity, and the production of valuable renewable energy.
    </FP>
    <FP>To recognize the importance of the many products generated from our Nation's forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as “National Forest Products Week” and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. As part of National Forest Products Week, let us rededicate ourselves to working together across public, Tribal, and private lands to sustain the ability of America's forests to continue to provide the multitude of benefits that will enhance our lives for generations to come.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 23, 2021, as National Forest Products Week. I call upon the people of the United States to join me in this observance and in recognizing all Americans who are responsible for the stewardship of our Nation's beautiful, forested landscapes.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>General Colin Powell was a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity. The son of immigrants, born in New York City, raised in Harlem and the South Bronx, a graduate of the City College of New York, he rose to the highest ranks of the United States military and to advise four Presidents. He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others. He embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. He repeatedly broke racial barriers, blazing a trail for others to follow, and was committed throughout his life to investing in the next generation of leadership. Colin Powell was a good man who I was proud to call my friend, and he will be remembered in history as one of our great Americans.</FP>
    <FP>
        As a mark of respect for General Powell and his life of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the

    <HD SOURCE="HED">United Nations Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Seventy-six years ago, emerging from the ashes of a devastating World War, countries around the world embarked on a shared mission: creating a rules-based international order, grounded in democratic values, to advance universal human rights, promote the peaceful settlement of disputes, and ensure adherence to international law. The United Nations was—and remains—the cornerstone of that international order, contributing to unmatched strides towards peace and prosperity shared around the world. Our collective resolve, expressed in the United Nations Charter, remains to uphold our “faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.” On United Nations Day, we celebrate the achievements of this bold declaration, reaffirm the inherent humanity that unites us, and renew our commitment to building a future that advances peace, dignity, and security for all.</FP>
    <FP>
        Today, we stand in a moment of great pain and extraordinary possibility. Globally, nearly 5 million lives have been lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate catastrophes continue to ravage our communities, inequalities and inequities are on the rise, democracy is under threat, and abuses of emerging technologies are destabilizing societies. Yet we also have new tools and new opportunities to rebuild a better world that is safer and freer for generations yet to come. It is clear that these global challenges require global cooperation, and the United States is determined to lead alongside our allies and partners to tackle the most pressing issues of our age. The United Nations remains the most important forum of its kind for mobilizing collective action to resolve global problems, maintain international peace and security, advance human rights, promote health and well-being, protect the vulnerable and marginalized, and sustain a rules-based international order. As the largest financial contributor to the United Nations, the United States has a deep stake in strengthening and modernizing the multilateral system to better enable us to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
        <PRTPAGE P="278"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The United Nations remains critical to advancing our national security and foreign policy interests. Since I took office, my Administration has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, launched a campaign for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council, and restored United States membership in and funding for the World Health Organization. Because none of us will be safe until all of us are safe, the United States is providing over $15 billion toward the global COVID-19 response and has delivered more than 190 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to nations around the world, including our COVAX donations. To date, we have pledged to donate more than 1.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we will continue to think big and do what we must to lead the world out of this pandemic. To ensure that the United Nations can play its central role in delivering global solutions for today's challenges, my budget proposal calls for the United States to pay its share of the United Nations' annual regular and peacekeeping budgets in full. With these key contributions, we are making clear to the world that America is committed to fulfilling its historic role and responsibility to safeguard and strengthen the rules-based order.</FP>
    <FP>We are at an inflection point in history. The choices we make in the next few years—whether or not we come together to face our greatest global challenges—will determine our future for decades to come. The United States stands firmly in support of the United Nations and will continue to rally the world to action not just with the example of our power but with the power of our example. Let us remember that our determination and faith in a better future laid the groundwork for the creation of the United Nations 76 years ago. Now, in a new century, we must work with allies and partners to strengthen the United Nations to effectively and efficiently tackle the challenges that defy political borders and geographical boundaries today. Tremendous work lies ahead of us, but we all share the responsibility to recommit ourselves to the original vision and values enshrined in the United Nations Charter: freedom, equality, opportunity, and human dignity. By doing so, we can build back a better world and ensure America's lasting leadership on the world stage.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2021, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 PandemicBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The continued spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat to our health and safety. COVID-19 has resulted in more than 733,000 deaths in the United States and more than 4,932,000 deaths worldwide. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 have also emerged globally, and variants that are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than the original virus strain are identified by the United States Government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group as variants of concern. Globally, as of October 20, 2021, 166 countries have reported cases of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, a variant of concern that spreads more easily than previously discovered variants of SARS-CoV-2. The potential emergence of a variant of high consequence—one that significantly reduces the effectiveness of prevention measures or medical countermeasures—is also a primary public health concern.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to prevent further introduction, transmission, and spread of COVID-19 into and throughout the United States, including from international air travelers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19, including preventing infection by the Delta variant, is for individuals to get vaccinated. According to the CDC, vaccinated individuals are 5 times less likely to be infected and 10 times less likely to experience hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals. Other mitigation measures are also critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19. These measures include testing and mask-wearing, which are particularly important strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19 from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, as well as self-quarantining and self-isolating. But vaccination is the most important measure for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission and for avoiding severe illness, hospitalization, and death.</FP>
    <FP>Substantial efforts are being made to increase vaccination rates across the globe. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines is rising, and over 6 billion doses have been administered globally. As of October 24, 2021, 29 countries have a COVID-19 vaccination rate higher than 70 percent, many countries are making efforts to encourage COVID-19 vaccination for their populations, and some countries are considering or adding proof of vaccination requirements as conditions for entry. Many low-income countries continue to have limited vaccine availability, but the United States is leading a global effort to donate hundreds of millions of vaccine doses where they are needed the most.</FP>
    <FP>
        In light of these facts and circumstances, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to move away from the country-by-country restrictions previously applied during the COVID-19 pandemic and to adopt an air travel policy that relies primarily on vaccination to advance the safe 
        <PRTPAGE P="280"/>
        resumption of international air travel to the United States. This proclamation governs the entry into the United States of noncitizen nonimmigrants—that is, noncitizens who are visiting the United States or otherwise being admitted temporarily—traveling to the United States by air. It suspends the entry of unvaccinated noncitizen nonimmigrants, except in limited circumstances, and it ensures that the entry of unvaccinated noncitizen nonimmigrants is consistent with applicable health and safety determinations made by the Director of the CDC, including a requirement that, where appropriate, such individuals agree and arrange to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 upon their arrival. My Administration has also taken action, apart from this proclamation, to ensure that noncitizen immigrants are vaccinated prior to air travel to the United States.
    </FP>
    <FP>Together, these policies aim to limit the risk that COVID-19, including variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, is introduced, transmitted, and spread into and throughout the United States, potentially overwhelming United States healthcare and public health resources, endangering the health and safety of the American people, and threatening the security of our civil aviation system. Given the resumption of air travel as worldwide restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic begin to ease, these policies will, consistent with the measures required by Executive Order 13998 of January 21, 2021 (Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel), advance the safety and security of the air traveling public, the government personnel responsible for ensuring the security of air travel, and the millions of individuals employed by the United States air travel industry, as well as their families and communities, while also allowing the domestic and global economy to continue its recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1182(f) and 1185(a) of title 8, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that it is in the interests of the United States to advance the resumption of international travel to the United States, provided necessary health and safety protocols are in place to protect against the further introduction, transmission, and spread of COVID-19 into and throughout the United States. I further find that vaccination requirements are essential to advance the safe resumption of international travel to the United States and that the unrestricted entry of persons described in section 2 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 3(a) of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For generations, American infrastructure—from the Erie Canal and the Transcontinental Railroad to the Hoover Dam—has been a cornerstone of our economic power, providing jobs, facilitating transportation, bolstering security, and overcoming barriers posed by distance and geography. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we renew our commitment to securing and enhancing the resilience of our Nation's critical infrastructure.</FP>
    <FP>Threats to the critical infrastructure that we all depend on, which underpins our economic and national security, are among the most significant and growing concerns for our Nation, including cyber threats, physical threats, and climate threats. Our country has seen how the technologies we rely on can be targeted by criminal activity and how extreme weather exposes the weaknesses in our power, water, communication, and transportation networks. We must do everything we can to safeguard and strengthen the systems that protect us; provide energy to power our homes, schools, hospitals, businesses, and vehicles; maintain our ability to connect; and ensure that we have reliable access to safe drinking water. While our Nation has been resilient as we have navigated this pandemic, we must continue investing in our workforce to keep pace with the threats we face and ensure we are building back better.</FP>
    <FP>I am committed to protecting our critical infrastructure and improving security and resilience efforts across the Nation. Most of our Nation's critical infrastructure—from communication lines to transportation networks—depends on coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, along with industry partners. That is why, earlier this year, my Administration launched an Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative to strengthen the security of our country's critical infrastructure, which has already created 100-day action plans for the electricity and natural gas pipeline sectors, with more to come, and we institutionalized that Initiative with a National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems. The voluntary initiative is a collaborative effort between the Federal Government and our private sector partners to significantly improve the cybersecurity of our critical systems by providing technologies that detect threats and can respond in essential control system and operational technology networks. The Department of Homeland Security and the National Institute of Standards and Technology are also partnering with the private sector to develop ‘performance goals’—cybersecurity baselines that will improve our Nation's security if critical infrastructure sectors adopt them. Finally, critical infrastructure resilience greatly benefits from close partnerships at home and abroad, and this October, my Administration launched a Counter Ransomware Initiative with more than 30 partners and allies.</FP>
    <FP>
        At home, my Administration is committed to making a once-in-a-generation investment to prioritize secure, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure. Streamlining access to Federal programs and grants to help States and local 
        <PRTPAGE P="286"/>
        government build capacity helps ensure we are modernizing our infrastructure to be more climate-resilient and building a clean energy future that will create millions of jobs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes $550 billion for our Nation's roads and bridges, water infrastructure, internet, and more. Our agenda also contains the largest Federal investment in power transmission in our Nation's history, ensuring a more reliable grid that has the capability to carry more renewable energy. These investments will strengthen our Nation and bolster our ability to lead, and they will help mitigate socio-economic disparities, advance racial equity, facilitate equitable recovery, and promote affordable access to opportunities for every American. Protecting our critical transportation infrastructure—including our bridges and roads—takes all of us working together.
    </FP>
    <FP>A key dimension of the Nation's resilience is safeguarding our democracy, which requires securing our election infrastructure. We have made tremendous progress working with State and local election officials over the past several years, but there is more to be done. We are particularly focused on improving the physical security of election officials as they face increasing threats of violence, securing election systems from cyber attacks, and confronting one of the most significant threats we see today:  disinformation campaigns designed to undermine confidence in our elections, and ultimately, confidence in our democracy and our democratic institutions.</FP>
    <FP>The threats against our critical infrastructure are increasingly complex and nuanced, and we all must be prepared to better protect ourselves from malicious actors threatening our cyber and physical security. That means staying vigilant, investing in new security measures, being prepared to respond to threats, and collaborating more with our partners. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting our infrastructure today and securing it for tomorrow.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate measures to enhance our national security and resilience.</FP>

    <FP>
        Every child deserves to grow up with a safe and loving family, with the care and support of their community. During National Adoption Month, we 
        <PRTPAGE P="287"/>
        celebrate all of the children and families nurtured, enriched, and made whole by adoption and recommit ourselves to ensuring that every child in America can grow up in a loving and supportive home.
    </FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has made it especially challenging for children in the foster care system. For thousands of young people in foster care, navigating the challenges of growing up can be especially difficult without stable family connections. Because of the added difficulties imposed by the pandemic, my Administration has implemented the substantial investments made through the Supporting Foster Youth and Families Through the Pandemic Act to help older adolescents transitioning from the foster care system maintain housing, stay in school, pay the bills, and lay a strong foundation for adulthood. My Administration encourages States to continue using these available funds to support older foster youth in every way they can.</FP>
    <FP>During this month, we also acknowledge the history of injustices and racial bias in our Nation's child welfare system. To this day, Black and Native American children are more likely to be removed from their homes, more likely to stay in care longer, and less likely to be adopted than white children. To ensure the equal dignity and care of all our children, we must improve our efforts to keep families together, prevent the trauma of unnecessary child removal, and recruit and support new adoptive families—especially kinship caregivers. Finally, we must further support families who have already taken youth into their homes and invest the time and energy needed to ensure that all children—including LGBTQ+ youth whose needs are not always met in the foster care system—can find the happiness and well-being that every child and young person deserves.</FP>
    <FP>This National Adoption Month, we celebrate the families who have been forged through adoption, including from foster care. We extend our gratitude to the dedicated professionals who work tirelessly to support adoptive families through compassion and hard work and to the foster families who love, care, and provide for our Nation's foster youth. Most importantly, we acknowledge the strength and resiliency of the children and youth who are still waiting to find their forever homes.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by helping children and youth in need of a permanent home secure a more promising future with a forever family and enter adulthood with the love and connections that are so important to their growth.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For more than 6 million Americans and the family members and friends who love them, Alzheimer's disease can be devastating. This common form of dementia is a cruel and fatal condition that erodes the ability to think, to recall precious memories, and to live independently. During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we stand with all those families confronting this challenging disease and recommit ourselves to improving treatment and finding a cure.</FP>
    <FP>A leading cause of death in seniors, Alzheimer's exacts a heartbreaking human toll on our Nation—as well as a deep economic toll, with the cost of treatment exceeding $300 billion in 2020 alone. But recent advances in biomedical science offer hope for better days ahead. As the scientific community continues to make strides toward a better understanding of Alzheimer's—and, ultimately, a cure—it is critical that we do all we can to expedite progress and alleviate the suffering caused by this disease.</FP>
    <FP>To that end, I have asked the Congress to fund a new program called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). Modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, a Government program that led to the creation of the Internet, GPS, and countless other vital technologies, ARPA-H would accelerate our research on detecting, treating, and curing diseases like Alzheimer's. My Administration is also building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration's National Plan to address Alzheimer's, which set our Nation on an aggressive course to improve research, provide optimal medical care, and enhance long-term services to meet the needs of families in the United States currently living with this terrible disease. As we pursue this effort, my Administration is also committed to ensuring that people who are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's and related dementias—especially older Black and Brown Americans, who are 2 to 3 times more likely to be affected—are seen, heard, and included in the quest to treat and prevent these conditions.</FP>
    <FP>As we mark National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we also honor those who care and provide for the victims of this devastating disease. The work of our Nation's caregivers can be physically demanding and emotionally exhausting—especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when caregivers have made substantial sacrifices to protect their loved ones suffering from Alzheimer's. Caregivers deserve our respect as well as our support, which is why the American Rescue Plan invested $145 million to help caregivers provide for their loved ones—a foundation that my Administration's Build Back Better agenda will build upon.</FP>
    <FP>
        I believe that our Nation stands at an unprecedented moment of scientific promise—it is critical that we keep up the fight against Alzheimer's until a cure is found and continue to care for all those affected by this condition in the meantime.

I call upon the people of the United States of America to learn more about Alzheimer's and to offer their support to the individuals living with this disease and to their caregivers.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National College Application Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>When America made 12 years of public education universal more than a century ago, it gave us the best-educated, best-prepared workforce in the world—which in turn was a major part of why we were able to lead the world in the 20th century. Today, however, we know that 12 years is no longer enough to compete. American students deserve every opportunity to gain the skills they need to carve out a place for themselves in tomorrow's economy. But according to a recent study, the United States now ranks 33rd out of 44 advanced economies when it comes to the share of our young people who have attained a degree beyond high school.</FP>
    <FP>If we are going to set the pace around the globe once more—on research and development, innovation and discovery, equity and opportunity, and creating good-paying jobs with dignity—it is imperative that we put an affordable, high-quality education after high school within reach of every American student. During College Application Month, we celebrate the possibilities that postsecondary education provides and encourage Americans to apply to colleges and universities as we work to ensure that every student has a chance to reach their full potential and strengthen our Nation's future.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is working hard to ensure that higher education is equitable, accessible, and affordable for every student in every community. That is why my Administration Build Back Better framework includes major investments in community colleges, as well as our essential network of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). In addition, my plan would increase the Federal Pell Grant award, a key resource to help students from lower-income families afford college—including costs beyond tuition. Each of these investments will help America's young people, including Dreamers, earn a better shot at the good-paying jobs of tomorrow. My Administration is also working to modernize the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form. Finally, we are taking steps to ensure that academic institutions do a better job of providing students with clear 
        <PRTPAGE P="290"/>
        and transparent information on how much they can expect to pay for college and their options to afford those costs.
    </FP>
    <FP>However, as important to our Nation's future as accessing college is, college completion is just as critical. Far too many students enter college only to have to drop out before graduation, and we are seeing firsthand how the pandemic has exacerbated the challenges students face as they seek to complete their studies. COVID-19 has significantly increased economic insecurity for families across the country, particularly for people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and those in low-income communities, resulting in new, unequal barriers to college enrollment and completion. My Administration stands ready to support our Nation's colleges in welcoming back every student who had to put their education goals on hold due to the pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration has also called for bold investments in completion and retention at colleges and universities that serve high numbers of low-income students—including community colleges—so that all Americans have the opportunity to obtain an education beyond high school. These investments would help cover proven solutions for student success, including providing wraparound services such as child- and elder-care, mental health services, accessibility resources, and emergency basic needs grants, in order to help more Americans enter and graduate college.</FP>
    <FP>Additionally, my Administration is working hard to provide institutions with funding and flexibility to meet students' needs. Earlier this year, we launched an outreach campaign to millions of Federal Pell Grant recipients who are now eligible for a monthly discount on broadband internet service under a temporary program administered by the Federal Communications Commission. We have also partnered with other agencies across the Federal Government to notify institutions and their students about expanded access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, health care benefits, tax cuts for those raising children, and financial aid and postsecondary education opportunities for students and families facing unemployment.</FP>
    <FP>This month, we celebrate the hard work and promise of students across the country and recommit ourselves to building back better by ensuring that everyone in America can pursue and complete a high-quality, affordable higher education. We thank the parents and loved ones, teachers, professors, administrators, financial aid professionals, college access organizations, mentors and counselors who help our students throughout the college application process and beyond.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National College Application Month. I call upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities designed to encourage students to make plans about, apply for, and graduate from college.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Diabetes Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Over the last 20 years, our Nation has seen a significant rise in the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes—a chronic condition that can lead to heart disease, kidney disease, vision loss, and other serious health problems. Today, more than 34 million American adults are living with diabetes, and an estimated 88 million more may be at risk of developing the disease. During National Diabetes Month, we draw awareness to all forms of this dangerous condition—including Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes and prediabetes—and recommit ourselves to finding a cure.</FP>
    <FP>Over the last year and a half, people living with diabetes have faced heightened risks to their health, as their illness makes them more vulnerable to the worst effects of COVID-19. This has been especially true for far too many Black, Brown, and Indigenous Americans, who face a disproportionate risk of being diagnosed with diabetes and who have shouldered the burden of the pandemic at disproportionate rates. More young Americans are also living with Type 2 diabetes than ever before, putting them at risk of developing serious health problems later in life. Americans who are diagnosed have faced the added challenge of unacceptably high insulin prices—putting their health and the financial well-being of their family at risk.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to finding a cure for diabetes. To that end, I have asked the Congress to fund a new agency called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). Modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, a Government program that led to the creation of the Internet, GPS, and countless other vital technologies—ARPA-H would accelerate our research on detecting, treating, and curing diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's. In addition to this effort, my Administration has provided funding through the American Rescue Plan to address diabetes and other chronic diseases by shoring up our public health infrastructure and combatting hunger and food insecurity. To lower the costs faced by more than 7 million Americans who require insulin to treat their diabetes, I have called on the Congress to give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, especially for companies that do not face competition.</FP>
    <FP>As we work together to fight diabetes, my Administration will continue to build on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and strengthen the coverage it provides for nearly 2 million American adults with diabetes. The ACA continues to connect people with services and health care providers who can ensure appropriate testing, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and the many conditions it can spawn. Millions of families enrolled in private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid are benefiting from the ACA's critical provisions, which help Americans with diabetes live better, longer lives as we continue searching for a cure.</FP>
    <FP>
        While we continue to seek that cure, my Administration is also working to improve our awareness and prevention of Type 2 diabetes. Thanks in part to the Diabetes Prevention Program at the National Institutes of Health, 
        <PRTPAGE P="292"/>
        we know that lifestyle changes—including increased physical activity and healthy eating—can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes for people at high risk. Eligible Americans can also take part in the National Diabetes Prevention Program, a lifestyle change program led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at sites around the country. Because so many cases of diabetes go undiagnosed, the CDC offers an online risk test so that everyone can learn about their risk factors for the disease.
    </FP>
    <FP>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin, a crucial hormone that has saved millions of lives. As we continue our work to lower health care costs, expand coverage, and find a cure for diabetes, we commemorate this important discovery and recommit ourselves to improving treatment for all types of diabetes.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the month of November 2021 as National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every day, American entrepreneurs combine passion, resilience, and ingenuity to solve hard problems and create products and businesses that improve our lives. American entrepreneurs create and scale new technologies, products, and services. They build businesses and, in some cases, entire industries. Their work helps grow our economy, creates good jobs, and increases our prosperity. Entrepreneurs have repeatedly risen to meet our Nation's and our world's complex challenges, and during National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs—both past and present—who exemplify the American spirit and recognize their important contributions to our people, our economy, and the world.</FP>
    <FP>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has posed historic challenges to our country and our Nation's entrepreneurs. Many businesses closed, and main streets became quiet. Despite these setbacks, American entrepreneurs showed incredible fortitude, finding innovative and effective ways to adapt their businesses as we fight a once-in-a-century crisis. To help our Nation's businesses and entrepreneurs recover during the pandemic, my Administration ensured that nearly $300 billion in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program 
        <PRTPAGE P="293"/>
        loans went to our smallest businesses, with more than 95 percent going to businesses with less than 20 employees, and provided over $28 billion in support to over 100,000 businesses through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. In the midst of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, Americans started more than 4 million businesses last year, a 24 percent increase from the year before—the highest number of monthly business applications on record—and start-up rates growing the most among immigrants and Black, Latino, and Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Americans. This is important for our future success, as small businesses are the engines of our economic progress—and the heart and soul of our communities.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to supporting all of our Nation's entrepreneurs to ensure that they can continue to play a key role in strengthening our economy and our society for years to come. My Administration's Build Back Better framework will deliver on the crucial infrastructure investments that form the foundation for success for entrepreneurs across the country. From investing in universal, affordable broadband to making the largest-ever Federal investments in public transit, passenger rail, and bridges, we will reinvigorate communities and their local economies. My Administration's framework will also provide much needed support for our entrepreneurs, including new loan and venture capital programs targeting the smallest businesses, small manufacturers, clean energy start-ups, and others, as well as investing in childcare, health care, and workforce development. We will also provide more support to businesses seeking to participate in the hundreds of billions of dollars that the Federal Government spends each year in procuring goods and services and investing in research and development. My Administration will fully implement the $10 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, which will allow States to set up new small business loan and venture capital programs, established by the American Rescue Plan.</FP>
    <FP>Collaboration among entrepreneurs, innovators, and the public sector has led to some of the most important technologies and industries in the world, including cellular communication, energy storage, agricultural technology, and advanced manufacturing. My Administration is proud to support entrepreneurs and innovators throughout this country—from the hardworking women and men who start a business to meet the needs of their communities to the visionaries who strive to change the world. Together, we are partners in solving challenges big and small, global and local—and will work to increase American competitiveness around the world and meet the challenges of the 21st century.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National Entrepreneurship Month.

    <FP>Every day, millions of Americans provide essential care and medical assistance to their loved ones. These acts of love, commitment, and compassion enable their family members to receive the support they need to live a life with dignity. This has been especially true throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Americans of all ages have made substantial sacrifices to keep family members safe and healthy. During National Family Caregivers Month, we recognize the important role of our Nation's family caregivers and thank them for the invaluable and instrumental care they provide.</FP>
    <FP>While the opportunity to provide care to a loved one can be a blessing and a source of connection, it often requires sacrifice. Millions of Americans have sacrificed jobs and altered careers in order to perform caregiving duties. Workers, their families, and our economy suffer when workers are forced to choose between their jobs and their caregiving responsibilities or between putting food on the table and caring for a relative. Too many Americans who need caregiving support struggle with the high costs of caring for a family member in need, or providing long-term care for people with disabilities or older adults.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to strengthening American families and easing the burdens of caregiving. That is why my American Rescue Plan provided an additional $145 million in funding for the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which continues to help State and community organizations support family and informal caregivers through in-home programs including counseling, respite care, and training. The American Rescue Plan also provided States with additional Medicaid funding to strengthen and enhance their home- and community-based services (HCBS) program. My Administration's Build Back Better agenda will build on this down payment by continuing to invest in the caregiving infrastructure for HCBS and increasing pay and benefits to address the direct care workforce crisis. I will also fight to expand paid family and medical leave nationwide. Each of these elements is critical to better supporting family caregivers. We want to see our Nation's paid caregivers, including the majority of home health care workers and over 90 percent of child care workers who are women—disproportionately women of color—have jobs that provide dignity, safety, and decent pay.</FP>
    <FP>Earlier this year, the RAISE (Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage) Family Caregiving Advisory Council, with support from the Department of Health and Human Services, delivered an initial report on how the Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments can work with our partners in the private sector to better support our Nation's family caregivers, and we will continue working to provide that support.</FP>
    <FP>
        As my own family members have been caregivers, I understand the struggles family caregivers face and the importance of the care they provide. This month, as we continue our fight to expand access to caregiving, we 
        <PRTPAGE P="295"/>
        recognize our caregivers who wake up every single day to do this physically and emotionally demanding yet vitally important work.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to reach out to those who provide care for their family members, friends, and neighbors in need, to honor and to thank them.</FP>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Native American Heritage Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The United States of America was founded on an idea: that all of us are created equal and deserve equal treatment, equal dignity, and equal opportunity throughout our lives. Throughout our history—though we have always strived to live up to that idea and have never walked away from it—the fact remains that we have fallen short many times. Far too often in our founding era and in the centuries since, the promise of our Nation has been denied to Native Americans who have lived on this land since time immemorial.</FP>
    <FP>Despite a painful history marked by unjust Federal policies of assimilation and termination, American Indian and Alaska Native peoples have persevered. During National Native American Heritage Month, we celebrate the countless contributions of Native peoples past and present, honor the influence they have had on the advancement of our Nation, and recommit ourselves to upholding trust and treaty responsibilities, strengthening Tribal sovereignty, and advancing Tribal self-determination.</FP>
    <FP>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated preexisting inequities facing Tribal Nations. Early in the pandemic, reported cases in the Native American community were over 3 times the rate of white Americans; in some States, Native American lives were lost at a rate 5 times their population share. Even as they shouldered a disproportionate burden throughout the pandemic, Tribal Nations have been paragons of resilience, determination, and patriotism—implementing key mitigation strategies like testing and prioritizing the vaccination of Tribal communities at high rates in order to save lives. Through it all, Tribal Nations have effectively utilized the tools of Tribal self-governance to protect and lead their communities, setting a standard for all of our communities to follow.
        <PRTPAGE P="296"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Our Nation cannot live up to the promise of our founding as long as inequities affecting Native Americans persist. My Administration is committed to advancing equity and opportunity for all American Indians and Alaska Natives and to helping Tribal Nations overcome the challenges that they have faced from the pandemic, climate change, and a lack of sufficient infrastructure in a way that reflects their unique political relationship.</FP>
    <FP>As a starting point, the American Rescue Plan represented the most significant funding legislation for Indian Country in the history of our Nation—the largest single Federal investment in Native communities ever, with $20 billion in direct funding to help Tribal governments combat and emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal and my Build Back Better framework, my Administration is pushing for strong Tribal participation to help build our Nation's clean energy future, deploy clean water and high-speed internet to every home, and invest in Native American families, businesses, jobs, and communities.</FP>
    <FP>In my first week in office, I also signed a Presidential Memorandum committing my Administration to the fulfillment of our Federal trust and treaty responsibilities, to respect Tribal self-governance, and to conduct regular, meaningful, and robust consultations with Tribal Nations on a broad range of policy issues. Together, we are implementing a whole-of-government approach to empower Tribal Nations in their efforts to achieve political and economic self-sufficiency, advance climate resiliency, and protect their territorial sovereignty. To further elevate the voices of Native Americans in my Administration, I restarted the White House Council on Native American Affairs earlier this year. It was among the proudest honors of my life to appoint one of our country's most remarkable leaders, Deb Haaland of the Pueblo of Laguna, to serve as United States Secretary of the Interior—the first Native American in the history of our Nation to serve in the Cabinet.</FP>
    <FP>During National Native American Heritage Month, we also honor our Native Americans veterans and service members who have courageously served and continue to serve in our Armed Forces—including the brave Native American Code Talkers in World War I and World War II. For over 200 years, Native Americans have defended our country during every major conflict and continue to serve at a higher rate than any other ethnic group in the Nation. Because of their selflessness, every generation of Americans receives the precious gift of liberty—and we owe each of them and their families a debt of gratitude for their sacrifice and dedication.</FP>
    <FP>Native American roots are deeply embedded in this land—a homeland loved, nurtured, strengthened, and fought for with honor and conviction. This month and every month, we honor the precious, strong, and enduring cultures and contributions of all Native Americans and recommit ourselves to fulfilling the full promise of our Nation together.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National Native American Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well as their elected representatives at the Federal, State, and local levels, to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to celebrate November 26, 2021, as Native American Heritage Day.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Veterans and Military Families Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America has the greatest Armed Forces in the history of the world. To those who serve and those that serve alongside them—their families and caregivers—we owe a debt we can never fully repay. During National Veterans and Military Families Month, we recognize and thank them for their indispensable contributions and immeasurable sacrifices in support of our national security. As we approach this season of thanksgiving, we send our gratitude to millions of service members, veterans, military families, caregivers, and survivors who have served and continue to serve our Nation. I have said many times, and it comes from my heart—we as a Nation have a sacred obligation to properly equip and prepare our troops when we send them in to harm's way and to support them and their families, both while they are deployed and when they return home.</FP>
    <FP>The First Lady and I know that it is not only the person who wears the uniform serving our country but also their families who make enormous sacrifices for our Nation. As the poet John Milton wrote, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” We understand the feelings of pride, uncertainty, and fear when a loved one is deployed. Every morning, you wake up and say that extra prayer for them.</FP>
    <FP>Our veteran and military families do so much and ask for little. They are strong and adaptable, changing course to accommodate the needs of our country, often foregoing personal wishes. They are capable and proud, holding down the home front during their loved one's deployments, coping through their absence and the risk of danger, and helping them readjust when they come home.</FP>
    <FP>These families and their Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Guardians, and Coast Guardsmen, are simply the best America has to offer. When they do not have what they need to thrive, it is not only individuals who suffer. If service members are worried that their spouse is struggling to keep food on the table or that their child is having a hard time at school, it is harder to focus on their mission. That is why supporting military families is a national security imperative.</FP>
    <FP>
        Since the earliest days of my Administration, we have been committed to a whole-of-government approach to responding to the real-time needs of our military and veteran families. Through Joining Forces, the White House initiative to support veteran and military families, caregivers, and survivors, my Administration is addressing military spouse employment and 
        <PRTPAGE P="298"/>
        entrepreneurship, military child education, and family health and well-being. The First Lady has met with our Nation's military and veteran families, caregivers, survivors, and advocates to learn how we can better support and prioritize their needs. Those discussions help inform the efforts across the Government to share data, create innovative solutions, and implement evidence-based programs and policies. In September, Joining Forces and the National Security Council released a report outlining the first round of Administration-wide commitments and proposals for supporting military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. We are committed to continuing these efforts because we must, and we will, honor our sacred obligation to support our military and veteran families and ensure they receive the resources they need to thrive.
    </FP>
    <FP>Throughout November, we show our appreciation to the spouses, partners, children, caregivers, and survivors of our service members and veterans for their selfless sacrifice on behalf of the Nation. We honor them and their invaluable contributions; we share their pride in our Armed Forces; and we will never forget what they and their loved ones do for us.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2021 as National Veterans and Military Families Month. I call upon the people of the United States to honor veterans and military families with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">World Freedom Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For nearly 3 decades, the Berlin Wall stood as a physical symbol of the Cold War, dividing democratic West Berlin from communist East Berlin. Today, we remember the East Germans who escaped and those who died attempting to attain a life of freedom. We recognize the irrepressible human spirit that no wall could contain, which fueled the civil resistance, sacrifice, and courageous defiance of people across Central and Eastern Europe. We recall the euphoria and the hope of the East and West Berliners who gathered at the wall on November 9, 1989, chanting “Tor auf!”—“Open the gate!”</FP>
    <FP>
        It was the aspirations for freedom of the people of Central and Eastern Europe that ultimately brought down the Berlin Wall and overcame the Soviet Union's attempts to keep Europe divided by force. On World Freedom Day, we commemorate this historic event and honor all those who peacefully 
        <PRTPAGE P="299"/>
        rose up and claimed their freedom and all those who continue their legacy by peacefully working to end tyranny and oppression in our world today.
    </FP>
    <FP>Since the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, we have seen great progress to advance human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as to build and consolidate democratic institutions across the formerly communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and around the world. However, democracy is still fragile, and in too many places it remains under threat. Authoritarians elevate their own power over the rights of their citizens, and around the world we see aspiring autocrats trample the rule of law, attack freedom of the press, and undermine an independent judiciary.</FP>
    <FP>In the face of resurgent authoritarianism and attacks on human rights around the globe, the United States is working to support democratic renewal and resilience at home and abroad. It remains as important as ever to counter the range of threats to democracy—and, ultimately, peace and stability—including transnational repression, corruption, cyberattacks, disinformation, digital authoritarianism, inequality and injustice, voter suppression, and economic coercion.</FP>
    <FP>World Freedom Day also reminds us of the hopeful future people still seek for themselves around the world. In recent years, brave women and youths in Sudan have withstood violence and oppression to push a genocidal dictator from power and today continue to defend their democratic progress. Proud Moldovans helped deliver a victory for the forces of democracy. Citizens of Zambia, especially young people, turned out in historic numbers to elect their new president. Ukraine continues to make progress in countering corruption, safeguarding human rights, and strengthening its democratic institutions all while standing up to Russian aggression. Courageous anti-corruption activists, human rights defenders, journalists, and peace protestors in Belarus, Burma, Cuba, Hong Kong, Syria, Venezuela, and elsewhere continue to demand respect for their human rights and a democratic future. To all those who continue to endure repression under authoritarian regimes, know that the people of the United States stand with you.</FP>
    <FP>Today, we reaffirm our commitment to the ideal that democracy—a Government of the people, by the people, and for the people—is how we best safeguard the rights, freedoms, and dignity that belong to every person. Together with other free nations, the United States remains committed to the vital work of strengthening our democratic institutions, defending civil society, advancing human rights, and holding those who commit abuses and foster corruption accountable. To demonstrate this, on December 9-10, 2021, I will host a virtual Summit for Democracy to help set an agenda for democratic renewal across the globe.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2021, as World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to recall the hope symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reaffirm our dedication to freedom and democracy.</FP>

    <EAR>Proc. 10305</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Veterans Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For generations, millions of Americans have answered the call to serve—taking the sacred oath to defend and preserve our Nation's ideals of liberty and democracy. These patriots represent the best of us. On Veterans Day, we honor their service, dedication, and valor and are forever grateful for their sacrifice.</FP>
    <FP>Our Nation has only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our service members when we send them into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they return home. For our 19 million veterans, that means ensuring that they have access to the support and resources for a future of security, opportunity, and dignity. This is even more important as we continue to recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic.</FP>
    <FP>Our obligation to support our Nation's veterans and their families is personal for me and the entire Biden family, and I remain committed to ensuring that every veteran receives the care and support they have earned. The recently passed bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create millions of good jobs for veterans and grow opportunities for veteran-owned businesses. My Build Back Better framework also prioritizes improvements to VA health care, ensuring that every veteran—including our often-underserved female and LGBTQ+ veterans—receives competent, world-class health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Last month, the White House Gender Policy Council released the first-ever United States Strategy for Gender Equity and Equality, which included the unique needs and contributions of women service members and veterans. And the Department of Veterans Affairs is also working to get every eligible veteran the information and opportunity they need to register and vote, protecting their voice in the democracy they fought to preserve.</FP>
    <FP>Ensuring veterans have timely access to services and benefits is at the center of my Administration's commitment to fulfilling our sacred obligation. This includes addressing the adverse health effects of service-related exposures. In August, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced it will begin processing disability claims for respiratory conditions connected to exposure during military service in Southwest Asia and other areas. My Administration also added three conditions to the list of those presumptively associated with exposure to Agent Orange, ending the long wait for disability benefits for many Vietnam era veterans. In the coming months, we are committed to taking additional action to address potential adverse health effects associated with military environmental exposures.</FP>
    <FP>
        So many of our veterans carry the scars from their service—both visible and invisible—and it is our Nation's responsibility to help them heal. Too many veterans and service members have considered suicide or taken their own lives, and addressing this tragedy is a national responsibility. That is why I have made military and veteran suicide prevention a top priority, and earlier this month, I released a new comprehensive, cross-sector public health strategy to reduce military and veteran suicide. Implementing this 
        <PRTPAGE P="301"/>
        approach will unite us around a common mission and accelerate meaningful improvements in suicide prevention programs, helping us live up to our sacred obligation to those who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces.
    </FP>
    <FP>Fulfilling our Nation's promise to our veterans and military families, caregivers, and survivors is not only a moral imperative—it is crucial to our national security and to maintaining the finest military the world has ever known. We are a Nation that keeps our promises. That is why my Administration is dedicated to a whole-of-government approach in responding to the needs of our veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors.</FP>
    <FP>Through the First Lady's work with Joining Forces—the White House initiative to support veteran and military families, caregivers, and survivors—my Administration is addressing employment and entrepreneurship, military and veteran child education, and health and well-being for veteran families. Earlier this year, the First Lady met with military and veteran families to learn how we can better support and prioritize their needs, and in September, Joining Forces and the National Security Council released a report outlining the first round of Administration-wide commitments and proposals that support veteran and military families, caregivers, and survivors. These efforts will honor our sacred obligation to support our veteran families and ensure they receive the resources they need to thrive.</FP>
    <FP>On Veterans Day, we honor our Nation's veterans, who have given so much to protect our freedoms and the freedom of others around the globe. They represent the highest ideals of our country. While we can never fully repay the debt we owe these heroes, we will honor their service and provide them the care and support they deserve. We also salute and show gratitude for all who ensure our Armed Forces remain strong, united, and unmatched.</FP>
    <FP>In respect and recognition of the contributions our veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2021, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor, courage, and sacrifice of our veterans through appropriate ceremonies and private prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States of America and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. And I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities, to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">American Education Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>I have always believed that our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft—when we invest in their education, we are investing in the future of our Nation. During American Education Week, which marks its 100th anniversary this year, we celebrate the unparalleled power of education to lift our country to new heights, and we recommit ourselves to ensuring that every child in America receives a quality education.</FP>
    <FP>When America made 12 years of public education standard more than a century ago, it gave us the best-educated, best-prepared workforce in the world—setting us on a path to lead the world for the better part of the 20th century. Not only is quality, equitable education the engine of innovation and the fuel of a thriving economy—it is also key to preserving our democracy and advancing American ideals. But as the First Lady so often says, any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. The truth is that we are no longer keeping pace with other countries when it comes to investing in the next generation.</FP>
    <FP>While America once led the world in educational achievement, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development now ranks us 35th out of 37 major economies when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. Only about half of American 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in early childhood education—while in Germany, France, the UK, Latvia, and other nations, that number is more than 90 percent. According to one study from the Pell Institute, we now rank 12th among advanced economies when it comes to the percentage of our young people who have attained a post-high-school degree.</FP>
    <FP>Simply put—we cannot be competitive in the 21st century global economy if we do not accelerate degree attainment. It is more important than ever that we invest in education, particularly as schools and communities are still fighting to overcome the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. This virus has called upon the extraordinary resilience of our educators, school staff, students, and families, whose dedicated efforts over the last 19 months have helped keep millions of young people on a path to fulfillment and success. Now, we must match their determination with bold action to ensure that our children—and our Nation—are well-positioned to lead the world in the years ahead.</FP>
    <FP>
        To that end, my Administration provided resources through the American Rescue Plan that are helping schools and colleges safely return to in-person instruction and meet the academic, social, emotional, and financial needs of students most affected by the pandemic. My budget proposal for fiscal year 2022 more than doubles funding for schools that serve low-income students; invests in support for students with disabilities; increases Federal funding for community schools tenfold; and works towards my Administration's goal of doubling the number of school counselors, social workers, psychologists, and nurses so that teachers can focus on teaching. Finally, my Administration's Build Back Better framework would make transformational investments in our education system—including by making 2 
        <PRTPAGE P="303"/>
        years of high-quality pre-school available to every child in America. We will also make significant investments in education beyond high school: We will increase Pell Grants to help students from lower-income families attend college and invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other Minority-Serving Institutions to help ensure that young people from every neighborhood have a fair shot at the good-paying jobs of the future.
    </FP>
    <FP>In celebrating the centennial anniversary of American Education Week, let us acknowledge education's power to transform lives, uplift communities, and strengthen our democratic society. Let us honor all those who nurture our students and inspire the future leaders of our great Nation.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 14 through November 20, 2021, as American Education Week. I invite all Americans to join in expressing gratitude, now and throughout the year, for the educators and staff of our Nation's schools and colleges, and I encourage the observation of this week through appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to showcase engaging, high-quality education, celebrate the joy of learning, and prepare students of every background for success.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Apprenticeship Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For decades, Registered Apprenticeships have been a reliable pathway to the middle class. Apprenticeships train workers for good jobs and allow them to earn while they learn. These educational experiences are especially important for workers who did not attend college, as they provide these workers with the type of specialized training needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow. During National Apprenticeship Week, we highlight how this quality industry and worker-driven training model provides a critical talent pipeline and a means to strengthen our workforce and address our Nation's pressing challenges—from rebuilding our country's infrastructure to protecting against cybersecurity threats.</FP>
    <FP>
        As we build our economy back better and continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the especially important role apprenticeships play in providing training to workers looking to re-enter the workforce and young people who are seeking to enter the work force—in each case providing an opportunity to train and develop the skills needed for jobs of the future while earning a good income.
        <PRTPAGE P="304"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration supports the expansion of Registered Apprenticeships and the pathways they create to good jobs and union representation. That is why I rescinded an Executive Order that undermined Registered Apprenticeship programs by promoting less rigorous industry-recognized apprenticeships. To strengthen the voice of our workers who have been central to rebuilding our economy, my Administration reinstated the longstanding National Advisory Committee on Apprenticeships. Since apprenticeships are central to supporting the investments made in the American Rescue Plan and the Build Back Better Agenda, I have proposed we invest in high-quality job training and Registered Apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors like health care, child care, advanced manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy so that every American receives the skills required by employers for good, middle-class union jobs.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration also recently awarded nearly $100 million in State Apprenticeship Expansion, Equity and Innovation grants to bolster States' efforts to expand programming and inclusive recruitment strategies. These grants also aim to develop partnerships that ensure we have a workforce ready to staff new industries and non-traditional occupations, including industry sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. To facilitate the expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs, provide technical assistance to these programs, and help small- and medium-sized firms establish Registered Apprenticeships, we also invested nearly $31 million through cooperative agreements to establish four Registered Apprenticeship Technical Assistance Centers of Excellence. The centers will also work with public and private sector partners to expand opportunities in Registered Apprenticeship programs for women, youths, people of color, rural communities, justice-involved individuals, and people with disabilities. The centers are the culmination of a longstanding commitment to expand access to apprenticeships for traditionally underrepresented groups of workers and build on existing strategies that include the Women in Apprenticeship and Non-Traditional Occupations (WANTO) grant program, now in its 27th year.</FP>
    <FP>During National Apprenticeship week, we also commit to ensuring that people from populations that have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent discrimination, poverty, and inequality have an opportunity to participate in the workforce. In particular, given the historic underrepresentation of women in apprenticeship programs and the impact of the pandemic on women's labor force participation, there is even greater urgency to support women's participation in Registered Apprenticeships.</FP>
    <FP>Together, and with strengthened Registered Apprenticeships, we can build an even more successful, competitive, and diverse workforce.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 14 through November 20, 2021, as National Apprenticeship Week. I urge the Congress, State and local governments, educational institutions, industry and labor leaders, apprentices, and all Americans to support Registered Apprenticeship programs in the United States of America and to raise awareness of their importance in building a diverse and robust workforce to strengthen our national economy.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">America Recycles Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In recent months, I have traveled across the country to see firsthand the devastating toll of climate change. I have walked down streets in Louisiana, New Jersey, and New York where deadly storms and floods have destroyed the lives of working families, wiping homes and businesses off the map. I have sat with firefighters in Boise, Idaho, and surveyed damage from the Caldor Fire in northern California—just one large wildfire among dozens that together have burned more acres of American land this year than make up the State of New Jersey. Communities encompassing the homes of more than 100 million people—about 1 in 3 Americans—have been struck by extreme weather events in the last few months alone. Climate change is a blinking code red for our Nation.</FP>
    <FP>This crisis poses an existential threat, but we also know that it is within our power to defeat it. Today, half of all global greenhouse gas emissions are created when natural resources are taken from the Earth and made into usable products. By reducing, reusing, and recycling, we can decrease waste and the greenhouse gases that fuel the climate crisis while protecting our communities and our environment. On America Recycles Day, we celebrate efforts across the country to manage our resources responsibly and creatively, and we recommit ourselves to building a brighter and more sustainable future for all people.</FP>
    <FP>Although we have made significant progress since the first America Recycles Day over 2 decades ago, we still have work to do. Black, Brown, Indigenous, and low-income communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by higher pollution levels as well as detrimental health and environmental impacts from mismanaged waste. Our Nation's infrastructure has not kept pace with today's changing waste stream, and markets for recycled materials are decreasing. To improve our national recycling system and manage our precious resources equitably and sustainably, it is going to take all of us—including Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, our partners in the private sector, and individual Americans making a difference in their communities. We must continue to work together to properly recycle and manage materials throughout their lifecycles and ensure that every American's right to a healthy environment is fulfilled and protected.</FP>
    <FP>
        To help our Nation achieve our environmental and recycling goals, my Administration is releasing a National Recycling Strategy, which identifies objectives and actions necessary to help fight climate change and create a sustainable national recycling system. The actions this strategy recommends 
        <PRTPAGE P="306"/>
        will help us reach our national recycling goal, and the Federal Government will lead by example across our Federal buildings, lands, and national parks. The strategy also aims to increase access to recycling so that all Americans can meaningfully participate while ensuring that our solid waste management system does not disproportionately affect communities that are already overburdened with environmental impacts. Our workplaces, communities, and Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments can all take part in reshaping our recycling system into one that puts the United States at the forefront of environmental stewardship. You can visit www.epa.gov/recycle for more information on reducing, reusing, and recycling.
    </FP>
    <FP>As we continue to pursue bold action to tackle climate change, we can all do our part to create a more sustainable future by making simple changes in our own lives. Today and every day, we reaffirm our commitment to preserving our precious resources and creating a healthier, cleaner, more just world for our children and future generations.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2021, as America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their reducing, reusing, and recycling efforts throughout the year.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Responsible for Policies or Actions That Threaten Democracy in NicaraguaBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        In light of the importance to the United States of fostering democratic processes and institutions in Nicaragua to help the Nicaraguan people achieve their aspirations for democracy, and given the suppression of human rights and democracy in Nicaragua, I have determined that it is in the interest of the United States to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of members of the Government of Nicaragua, led by President Daniel Ortega, including his spouse and Vice President Rosario Murillo, and others described in this proclamation who formulate, implement, or benefit from policies or actions that undermine or injure democratic institutions or impede the return to democracy in Nicaragua.
        <PRTPAGE P="307"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The repressive and abusive acts of the Ortega government and those who support it compel the United States to act. The Ortega government's crackdown on opposition leaders, civil society leaders, and journalists in preparation for the November 2021 Nicaraguan presidential and legislative elections harms the institutions and processes essential to a functioning democracy. The Ortega government's undemocratic, authoritarian actions have crippled the electoral process and stripped away the right of Nicaraguan citizens to choose their leaders in free and fair elections.</FP>
    <FP>The Ortega government's detention of and denial of fair trial guarantees to peaceful protesters, civil society leaders, private sector leaders, student leaders, political leaders, journalists, and presidential candidates in Nicaragua stifles political discourse and the democratic process. Police and prison authorities contribute to the repressive climate the Ortega government promotes by carrying out politically motivated arrests and detentions of individuals exercising their human rights and holding political prisoners incommunicado, without access to lawyers, family members, and needed medical care. Family members and the media have reported that some prisoners have lost significant weight in detention, cannot walk unassisted, have been held in solitary confinement, and are subjected to frequent, extensive interrogations. The physical and psychological abuse of political prisoners at the hands of police and prison authorities is intolerable and cannot stand.</FP>
    <FP>The Ortega government controls multiple security services, including non-uniformed, armed, and masked parapolice, who abuse persons to further the Ortega government's authoritarian agenda, including by harassing, threatening, and committing violence against those opposed to the government. Members of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP), along with violent mobs of pro-government supporters also controlled by government actors, have attacked religious institutions in retaliation for their support for political and religious leaders.</FP>
    <FP>Municipal officials, acting on direct orders from the Ortega government, have directed violence against pro-democracy protesters in their communities and other local actors opposed to the government. For example, mayors and mayors' offices loyal to the Ortega government have organized and channeled state funds to parapolice groups engaged in violent repression. These municipal officials wield enormous political power and discretionary budget authority, conferred upon them from the highest levels of the Ortega government. The climate of fear established and perpetuated by these municipal officials has diminished the possibility of free and fair elections and undermined democracy in Nicaragua.</FP>
    <FP>The judiciary has failed the Nicaraguan people by aiding and abetting the Ortega government's use of politically motivated charges to lock up political prisoners. By stacking the judiciary with government-controlled judges and prosecutors, the Ortega government has abused the justice system to silence critics. Authorities have held many political prisoners incommunicado for months, without access to their lawyers, and with no knowledge of the spurious charges presented against them.</FP>
    <FP>
        The widespread impunity for crimes committed against opposition actors; the persistent corruption practiced by Nicaraguan government officials in the performance of public functions that has eroded democratic institutions; and the continued failure of President Daniel Ortega, Vice President 
        <PRTPAGE P="308"/>
        Rosario Murillo, Nicaraguan government officials, and others to support the rule of law, human rights, and other principles of high priority to the United States demand a forceful response.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Antibiotic Awareness Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Antibiotic Awareness Week is an occasion to celebrate the miracles of science and medicine that improve and sustain our lives, including innovations in antibiotics that have transformed the treatment of illness. Antibiotics save lives, kill bacteria that cause infections, and make it possible for many modern health care practices—including cancer treatments or surgery—to be safely performed. This week is also an occasion to raise awareness of the dangers of misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic resistance.</FP>
    <FP>It is critical to the health of our Nation that antibiotics be used only as intended. In recent decades, the misuse of antibiotics has contributed to infectious germs becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotic drugs. Every year, more than 3 million people in the United States are infected—and nearly 50,000 are killed—by an antibiotic-resistant germ or an infection that can occur after taking antibiotics. Because most of these cases occur as a result of improper antibiotic use, it is essential that these drugs are used appropriately and only when necessary. During Antibiotic Awareness Week, we reaffirm our commitment to meet the challenge of antibiotic resistance and preserve the effectiveness of these lifesaving treatments.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to a strong public health response to antibiotic resistance. We are pursuing the ambitious goals laid out in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, building on evidence-based activities that slow the spread of antibiotic resistant infections and striving to scale up tracking of antibiotic use across the country through systems such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network. We know the kinds of interventions that work to maintain the integrity of antibiotics and strengthen antibiotic stewardship across industries, and we are implementing those interventions and providing resources to analyze data and address inequities in antibiotic prescribing and use. In addition, we are examining how disparities in health care access and quality of care exacerbate antibiotic-resistant infections.</FP>
    <FP>
        Every American has a vital role to play in this effort. Even small changes in how we use antibiotics can help defend against the threat of antibiotic resistance. Using the right antibiotic and the correct dosage for the proper duration at the prescribed time can help improve how antibiotics are used to prevent and control infections for all of us. During Antibiotic Awareness 
        <PRTPAGE P="311"/>
        Week, we commit to doing our part to take on the threat of antibiotic resistance and pursue strategies that will make all Americans safer and healthier.
    </FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through November 24, 2021, as Antibiotic Awareness Week. I call upon the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, industry leaders, and all Americans to observe this week by promoting the responsible use of antibiotics and raising awareness of the dangers inherent to their misuse and overuse.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Rural Health Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>America's rural communities feed and fuel our country, steward our precious lands, and are home to 1 out of every 5 Americans. As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and make the investments we need to build back better, we must ensure that our recovery includes and strengthens our Nation's rural communities. On National Rural Health Day, we recommit to supporting the health and well-being of rural Americans and celebrate the rural health care providers who work tirelessly to meet their needs.</FP>
    <FP>Rural Americans face unique challenges accessing the care they need and deserve. They often have to travel greater distances to see a health care provider, are less likely to have access to broadband to utilize telehealth services, and are more likely to live in an area that has a shortage of doctors, dentists, and mental health providers. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has spared no part of the country, rural areas have confronted additional challenges that affect the delivery of services, including limited health care infrastructure and fewer clinicians.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is committed to improving the health of rural communities and ensuring that those who call these communities home have equitable access to the resources and services routinely available to people living in more densely populated areas. That is why my American Rescue Plan (ARP) is providing $8.5 billion to rural health providers to keep their doors open and continue responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This builds on over $820 million in ARP spending from earlier this year to support COVID-19 testing and mitigation across 4,200 Rural Health Clinics and over 1,500 small rural hospitals and $100 million in ARP funding to support the vaccine outreach efforts of Rural Health Clinics. My Administration's plan also provided $500 million to create the Emergency Rural 
        <PRTPAGE P="312"/>
        Health Care Grant Program, which is helping rural communities provide more COVID-19 testing and treatment, purchase medical supplies, deliver food assistance, and renovate health care facilities. These investments are complemented by funds to expand telehealth and support training for new rural health care providers, including community health workers and respiratory therapists. This funding has supported thousands of Rural Health Clinics, small rural hospitals, and community health workers.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration's Build Back Better framework will build on the successes of the ARP by delivering lower cost, higher quality health care to rural Americans. My Administration's proposal is the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade and will lower prescription drug and other health care costs for rural Americans, keep rural hospitals open, and work to address the root causes of poor health, including outdated drinking water infrastructure across rural America. Additionally, my Administration is coordinating efforts across Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, and local governments and incorporating health equity principles, policies, and approaches in our efforts to better support rural communities. This means supporting rural hospitals and clinics, expanding telehealth and workforce development, improving community health, and providing greater access to capital so that every American can receive lower cost and higher quality health care.</FP>
    <FP>On National Rural Health Day, we recognize the importance of the health and well-being of our rural communities. As our Nation builds back better, we recommit to supporting our rural health care providers and working together to bring about a stronger, healthier rural America.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THERFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18, 2021, as National Rural Health Day.

        Our Nation's children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft—and it is our shared responsibility to make sure that they have every opportunity to thrive. On National Child's Day, we recommit ourselves to ensuring that every child in America has a fair shot at a bright future, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, or the zip code they are born into.
        <PRTPAGE P="313"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>To support our Nation's children, it is imperative that we work to deliver equal access to quality child care and education, health care, good jobs with dignity, and a clean planet. That is why I am working with the Congress to pass my Administration's Build Back Better plan—a transformative investment in children, families, climate resilience, and the foundations of our economy. The Build Back Better Act is poised to deliver high-quality child care that all families can afford, universal access to preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, lower costs for higher education so that every child has an equal footing and opportunity to succeed, historic tax cuts for working families raising children, the largest expansion of affordable health care coverage since the Affordable Care Act, and the largest investment to fight climate change in American history.</FP>
    <FP>This landmark legislation will help ensure that every child has a safer and healthier upbringing. It eases the cost burden of raising a family—delivering a tax cut directly into the pockets of working parents. It will help America once again set the pace around the world when it comes to educational attainment, reversing generations of underinvestment in our children's development and care. It will help us cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce pollution so that our children can breathe clean air. With the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act—we will also deliver high-speed internet access to every American household and replace our Nation's lead water pipes so that every child can drink clean water at home and at school. I will also continue to make the case for establishing a paid family and medical leave program so no worker has to make the impossible choice between work and caring for themselves or a family member.</FP>
    <FP>These historic bills build on the foundation we laid with the American Rescue Plan, which has set us on a course to reduce child poverty in America by nearly half. The law continues to deliver critical resources that have allowed our Nation's children to safely return to the classroom, and it provides essential tools to address the mental health needs of our children and much-needed relief to families to improve maternal and child health care.</FP>
    <FP>We owe every child the opportunity to dream and flourish, supported by adults helping to make their dreams a reality. On National Child's Day, we reaffirm our commitment to uplift the children in our lives and in our communities. Their future is our future, and our Nation's success tomorrow relies on the care and investment we provide for our children today.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2021, as National Child's Day.

    <FP>My father lived by a motto: that family was the beginning, the middle, and the end. During National Family Week, we celebrate American families, recognize the importance of spending time with relatives, and reaffirm our commitment to investing in our Nation's families.</FP>
    <FP>From the beginning of my campaign for President, I said that my goal was to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out and give America's hard-working families some much needed breathing room. This work is especially important, given the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented so many challenges for families. Many families struggled with lost jobs or food insecurity. Before schools reopened, parents and caregivers had to take on additional responsibilities such as helping their children with online learning, many while working from home. So many of us went months without hugging a parent, grandparent, or grandchild. Far too many families said goodbye to a loved one—leaving an empty chair at the table and a hole in their hearts.</FP>
    <FP>When I took office, I took immediate action to assist families through my Administration's American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan has provided cash assistance to millions of working families, supported schools in safely providing in-person instruction, and delivered an expanded Child Tax Credit, which is lifting millions of children and families out of poverty. It also allowed us to implement our COVID-19 vaccination program—one of the fastest vaccination programs ever, one that is now open to all Americans ages five and up, and one that is protecting millions of families.</FP>
    <FP>Now even greater progress for America's families is in sight. My Administration's Build Back Better Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will further strengthen and support our Nation's families. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will allow us to replace lead pipes and service lines that are poisoning our children and families while the other investments in the bill will strengthen communities and create millions of good jobs. My Administration's Build Back Better Act will provide free and universal preschool, the largest investment in child care in our Nation's history, an expansion of the Affordable Care Act, and a tax cut for millions of families with children. In addition, I will continue to push for establishing a paid family and medical leave program so that no American must make the difficult choice between work and caring for themselves or a family member.</FP>
    <FP>During National Family Week, we reaffirm that our Nation is stronger because of the love, compassion, and care that our families share. In this season of thanksgiving, let us continue to lift up our hard-working families and unite in support of our future generations.</FP>

It is why in the midst of the Civil War—in proclaiming the Thanksgiving holiday we now celebrate today—Abraham Lincoln urged us to remember our “fruitful fields and healthful skies.” Just as 400 years ago when the Pilgrims were able to celebrate a successful first harvest thanks to the generosity and support of the Wampanoag, today we too express our gratitude for those who have helped us get through this difficult past year.</FP>
    <FP>We are grateful for the farm workers and frontline workers, many of whom are immigrants, who make sure our food is harvested and shipped, keep our grocery stores stocked, and keep our cities and towns clean and safe.</FP>
    <FP>We are grateful for the educators who are welcoming children back into their classrooms, helping them make up for lost learning and lost time, both academically and socially.</FP>
    <FP>We are grateful for the parents who have carried their families through this challenging time, helping their children navigate this difficult chapter in our Nation's history.</FP>
    <FP>We are grateful for the health care professionals working to vaccinate our Nation, the nurses who comfort and help people, and the doctors who provide care and compassion.</FP>
    <FP>We are grateful for the researchers and scientists who have developed safe and effective vaccines and treatments, allowing us to safely enjoy a Thanksgiving this year with more family around the table.</FP>
    <FP>As always, we are grateful for our troops serving far from home, keeping us safe and defending our values.</FP>
    <FP>
        For the First Lady and me, Thanksgiving has always been a cherished time to enjoy annual traditions that have evolved into sacred rituals with our children and grandchildren: throwing the football, preparing family recipes, lighting candles, and setting the table. For many Americans, this 
        <PRTPAGE P="316"/>
        Thanksgiving will be the first time gathering with loved ones in person since the start of the pandemic—a time of full tables and full hearts.

    <FP>As we celebrate, we will also be thinking of the many families feeling the pain of an empty chair at the Thanksgiving table. You are not alone, and our Nation stands with you.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>The national emergency caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security. As of November 26, 2021, the United States has experienced more than 47 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 773,000 COVID-19 deaths. It is the policy of my Administration to implement science-based public health measures, across all areas of the Federal Government, to act swiftly and aggressively to prevent further spread of the disease.</FP>
    <FP>
        On November 24, 2021, the Republic of South Africa informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a new B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that was detected in that country. On November 26, 2021, the WHO Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution announced that B.1.1.529 constitutes a variant of concern. While new information is still emerging, the profile of B.1.1.529 includes multiple mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, some of which are concerning. According to the WHO, preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other variants of concern. Further, the WHO reports that the number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in the Republic of South Africa. Based on these developments, and in light of the extensive cross-border transit and proximity in Southern Africa, the detection of B.1.1.529 cases in some Southern African countries, and the lack 
        <PRTPAGE P="317"/>
        of widespread genomic sequencing in Southern Africa, the United States Government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, has reexamined its policies on international travel and concluded that further measures are required to protect the public health from travelers entering the United States from the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, and the Republic of Zimbabwe. In addition to these travel restrictions, the CDC shall implement other mitigation measures for travelers departing from the countries listed above and destined for the United States, as needed.

    <FP>Given the recommendation of the CDC, working in close coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, described above, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to suspend and restrict the entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of noncitizens of the United States (“noncitizens”) who were physically present within the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, and the Republic of Zimbabwe during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Every year, thousands of lives are needlessly lost on our Nation's roadways because of alcohol—and drug-impaired driving. These are avoidable tragedies that leave deep holes in our Nation's families and communities. During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we reaffirm our commitment to preventing impaired driving. We remember the victims and honor their memory by making the responsible decision to drive sober and ensure that others do the same.</FP>
    <FP>Driving while impaired by any substance—legal or illegal—is dangerous. Alcohol, illicit drugs, and even over-the-counter and prescription medications can impair a driver's judgment, decrease motor coordination, and slow the reaction time necessary to safely operate a motor vehicle. Alcohol-impaired driving has led to over 10,000 deaths each year.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to reducing the number of impaired drivers and raising awareness about the dangers of driving impaired. The new Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act calls for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue a new standard for “advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology” for new vehicles, which would help prevent impaired drivers from taking the wheel.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is building our capacity to end impaired driving by supporting innovative strategies that reduce impaired driving-related crashes, injuries, and fatalities while safeguarding against bias and ensuring racial equity. To identify and support people with substance use disorders, we are increasing impaired driving risk screening, supporting evidence-based prevention programs, and providing access to evidence-based treatment and recovery support services. My Administration is also raising awareness about the effects of impairment on driving ability through the 
        <E T="03">Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over</E>
         and 
        <E T="03">If You Feel Different, You Drive Different</E>
         national media campaigns.
    </FP>
    <FP>While our technology continues to advance and may one day help solve the problem of impaired driving, everyone must take individual responsibility and pledge to never drive while impaired and to deter others from making that fateful decision.</FP>
    <FP>During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to doing all we can to stop these preventable crashes and remember those who lost their lives as a result of impaired driving. We must also share our appreciation for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives each day to keep our communities safe while keeping impaired drivers off of our roadways.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2021 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">World AIDS Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>For decades, World AIDS Day has been recognized as an opportunity for people around the world to stand together in the fight against HIV. This year on World AIDS Day, we are focused on addressing health inequities and inequalities and ensuring that the voices of people with HIV are at the center of our work to end the HIV epidemic globally.</FP>
    <FP>While we have made remarkable progress in the 40 years since the first-known reported case of AIDS, this disease remains a serious public health challenge—and we join the international community to honor and remember the more than 36 million people, including 700,000 Americans, who have tragically died from AIDS-related illness since the start of the epidemic. We also renew our commitment to stand with the nearly 38 million people living with HIV around the world as we pursue our shared goal of ending the HIV epidemic.</FP>
    <FP>The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the challenges our heroic health care and frontline workers face, yet they continue to deliver essential HIV prevention services and provide vital care and treatment to people living with HIV. The pandemic has also interrupted HIV research and highlighted the work that still remains to achieve equitable access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment in every community—particularly for communities of color, adolescent girls and young women, and the LGBTQI+ community.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration remains steadfast in our efforts to end the HIV epidemic, confront systems and policies that perpetuate entrenched health inequities, and build a healthier world for all people. Earlier this year, I reinstated the White House Office of National AIDS Policy to coordinate our efforts to reduce the number of HIV infections across our Nation. This week, my Administration is releasing an updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy to decrease health inequities in new diagnoses and improve access to comprehensive, evidence-based HIV-prevention tools. This updated strategy will make equity a cornerstone of our response and bring a whole-of-government approach to fighting HIV.</FP>
    <FP>
        My budget request includes $670 million to support the Department of Health and Human Services' Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. Initiative—to reduce HIV diagnoses and AIDS-related deaths. My Administration has also strengthened the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS by adding members from diverse backgrounds who bring the knowledge and expertise needed to further our Nation's HIV response.
        <PRTPAGE P="322"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is committed to helping the world end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. Through the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), we have saved more than 21 million lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and supported at least 20 countries around the world to reach epidemic control of HIV or achieve their ambitious HIV treatment targets. This remarkable progress over the past 18 years has been made possible through strong, bipartisan United States leadership and American generosity. Now, together with partner governments and communities, my Administration is setting a bold vision for achieving sustained epidemic control of HIV by supporting equitable health services and solutions, contributing to improved health for all in PEPFAR-supported countries, and working with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; UNAIDS; and other regional and local partners toward the goal of ending the HIV epidemic everywhere.</FP>
    <FP>Ending the HIV epidemic is within our reach, and we are committed to finishing this work. On World AIDS Day, we rededicate ourselves to building on the progress of the last 4 decades; upholding and advancing human rights; supporting research, science, and data-driven solutions; expanding access to housing, education, and economic empowerment; and fighting stigma and discrimination. No one living with HIV should suffer the undeserved guilt and prejudice that too many continue to experience. We must innovate and explore new ways to help address HIV/AIDS in communities here at home and around the world.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2021, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the American people to join the HIV community in activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support, dignity, and compassion to those living with HIV.</FP>

    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        Thirty-one years ago, the bipartisan passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) enshrined our commitment to building a better Nation for all of us. In the years since, we have made profound progress to advance the rights, opportunities, full participation, and economic self-sufficiency of people with disabilities—both here at home and in nations around the world. On the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we reaffirm 
        <PRTPAGE P="323"/>
        the full promise of dignity, equity, and respect due to all disabled people and recognize the work that still remains to fully deliver on that promise.
    </FP>
    <FP>I was proud to co-sponsor the ADA as a member of the United States Senate. Today, that law remains a vital source of opportunity and dignity—a defense against discrimination and a path to independence. My Administration continues to build on the legacy of the ADA here at home and lead efforts for disability-inclusive democracies around the world. Earlier this year, I signed Executive Orders to recruit and retain a workforce that truly reflects the American people—including Americans with disabilities—and to help ensure that people with disabilities can exercise their sacred right to vote on a full and equal basis.</FP>
    <FP>We know that—both here in America and around the world—women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately impacted by gender inequality. That is why my Administration developed the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which aims to address discrimination rooted in the nexus of both gender and disability. The American Rescue Plan included landmark support for people with disabilities—including historic funding to expand home- and community-based services under Medicaid, which is enabling more Americans than ever to live safely and independently in their own homes. My Administration's Build Back Better plan will further that commitment by making the most transformative investment in access to home care in 40 years—providing life-changing support to people with disabilities and the dedicated workers who help care for them.</FP>
    <FP>To uphold and advance the human rights of people with disabilities worldwide, I reestablished the role of Special Advisor on International Disability Rights at the Department of State. My Administration will continue to take domestic and international actions to make democracy more accessible around the world. The Summit for Democracy on December 9-10 will affirm that a government of, by, and for the people—including those with disabilities—remains humanity's most enduring means to advance peace, prosperity, and security.</FP>
    <FP>Today and every day, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring dignity, equity, and respect for all people with disabilities. As we continue to build back better and address the challenges of the 21st century, we will ensure that we deal everybody in and bring everyone along.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2021, as International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

    <FP>On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked our forces at Pearl Harbor and other locations in Hawaii, taking the lives of 2,403 service members and civilians and leading the United States to declare its entrance into World War II. It was a day that still lives in infamy 80 years later. As we mark National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the patriots who perished, commemorate the valor of all those who defended our Nation, and recommit ourselves to carrying forth the ensuing peace and reconciliation that brought a better future for our world. Today, we give thanks to the Greatest Generation, who guided our Nation through some of our darkest moments and laid the foundations of an international system that has transformed former adversaries into allies.</FP>
    <FP>A decade ago, I paid my respects at the USS Arizona Memorial—where 1,177 crewmen lost their lives on that terrible December day. To this day, beads of oil still rise to the surface of the water—metaphorical “Black Tears” shed for those lost in the attack. Reading those names etched in marble was a mournful reminder of the sacrifices and the human cost of protecting our Nation and the ideals this great country represents. Our Nation remains forever indebted to all those who gave their last full measure of devotion eight decades ago. We will never forget those who perished, and we will always honor our sacred obligation to care for our service members, veterans, and their families, caregivers, and survivors.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as “National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.”</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>In the wake of the devastation of the Second World War, leaders from around the world came together with a shared vision to promote a safer future for all nations by securing and advancing the human rights of everyone, everywhere. On December 10, 1948, thanks to the moral leadership and service of Eleanor Roosevelt as the first Chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, the world took an enormous step forward with the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).</FP>
    <FP>
        The UDHR enshrines the human rights and fundamental freedoms inherent in all people—no matter who they are, where they come from, or whom they love. It is a foundational document that proclaims a truth too often overlooked or ignored—that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” From the root of this universal ideal has sprung transformational human rights treaties and a global commitment to advance equality and dignity for all as the foundation of freedom, peace, and justice. As a world, we have yet to achieve this goal, and we must continue our efforts to bend the arc of history closer to justice and the shared values that the UDHR enshrines. Just as we advocated for the recognition of universal human rights following World War II, the United States today remains steadfast in our commitment to advancing the human rights of all 
        <PRTPAGE P="326"/>
        people—and to leading not by the example of our power but by the power of our example.
    </FP>
    <FP>Since taking office, my Administration has put human rights at the center of our domestic and foreign policy priorities. We immediately declared our intention to rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council, and with the widespread support of the international community, our Nation was elected to a new term beginning on January 1, 2022. As a member of the Council, we will highlight the vital importance of democracy as we work to protect human rights and hold accountable those who would violate these rights and freedoms. We will continue to call out human rights violations wherever they occur, support brave activists on the front lines of protecting fundamental freedoms, and invest in strengthening the rule of law.</FP>
    <FP>As a global champion for democracy, we must also continue the unceasing work of strengthening our own democracy and building a more perfect union. Leading by example is one of the most powerful and persuasive foreign policy tools at our disposal. From day one of my Administration, we have taken concrete steps to reassert our moral leadership on the global stage. On my first day in office, I signed an Executive Order to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities. As part of our once-in-a-generation investment in our Nation's physical infrastructure, we are also strengthening equitable access to our shared resources and environment, including providing additional support for historically underserved communities.</FP>
    <FP>Unfortunately, discrimination and violence are challenges that too many Americans still face in their own communities. Throughout our Nation's history, generations of Black and Brown Americans, Indigenous persons, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ Americans, immigrants, women and girls, and members of religious, ethnic, and other historically marginalized groups have faced heightened threats to their human rights and dignity. Today, we know that our efforts to defend human rights around the world are stronger because we acknowledge and seek to remedy our own historical challenges as part of that same fight. Leading by example means speaking honestly about the past, upholding the truth, and striving constantly to improve.</FP>
    <FP>This year, as we commemorate Human Rights Day, my Administration will bring together global leaders, civil society organizations, and representatives from the private sector for the first Summit for Democracy. Working together, we will recommit ourselves to promoting respect for human rights and combating growing threats to democracy, including authoritarianism and corruption. We will speak honestly about the challenges we face, and we will identify meaningful new actions and commitments to advance our shared goals.</FP>
    <FP>I call upon all Americans to keep the words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in their hearts: “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Let us all dedicate ourselves to bringing our Nation and our world closer to a future in which every human being is free to pursue their highest dreams and unleash their full potential.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2021, as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2021, as Human

    <FP>
        More than two centuries ago, our Founders drafted the Constitution in order to create an American Government that could act with urgency on national issues without compromising individual rights and freedoms. They had the genius not only to craft such a Government but to foresee their own fallibility as well. In their foresight, they made the charter at the heart of our Nation a 
        <E T="03">living</E>
         document—including within it a process by which it could be amended to evolve and keep pace with the wisdom of passing time.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Opportunities to improve our Constitution have been contemplated since its inception. On December 15, 1791, three-fourths of the existing State legislatures ratified the first 10 Amendments of the Constitution—the Bill of Rights. These Amendments protect some of the most indispensable rights and liberties that define us as Americans. Though we have often struggled 
        <PRTPAGE P="328"/>
        to live up to the promises they contain, 230 years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms remains at the center of our democracy.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Bill of Rights is important not only in the freedoms it protects but in its demonstration of America's enduring commitment to self-improvement and striving to continuously form a “more perfect union.” Since 1791, 17 additional Amendments have been ratified for a total of 27 Amendments to the Constitution. From the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; to the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed birthright citizenship, promised “equal protection under the laws,” and safeguarded fundamental rights and fair process; to the several Amendments devoted to prohibiting electoral discrimination based on race, sex, age, and the inability to afford a tax; to the most recent amendment ratified in 1992 to keep members of Congress more responsive to their voters—our history of amending the Constitution illustrates that improving our democracy is the shared and constant duty of all Americans. Democracy's greatest strength is the ability it provides its citizens to improve their system of governance, which is why democracy is uniquely suited to face the challenges of a changing world.</FP>
    <FP>Just as our Founders overcame their differences to form the democracy we know today, our country continues to confront its problems head-on and work together to fix them, even in the face of disagreements. Respectful disagreement is healthy and American—indeed, it is protected by the Bill of Rights itself—but there is no place in a democracy for threats or violence.</FP>
    <FP>Earlier this month, the United States hosted the first ever Summit for Democracy, where Governmental and non-governmental leaders from around the world came together to set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal and to tackle the greatest threats faced by democracies today through collective action. By working with our democratic partners, we can meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2021, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Wright Brothers Day, 2021By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright achieved a feat that humankind had dreamed of since time immemorial—a sustained, controlled, powered flight that opened the skies to all humanity. Today, we honor the extraordinary achievements of the Wright Brothers and celebrate their enduring contributions to America's unparalleled leadership in flight.</FP>
    <FP>Many intrepid souls had tried and failed at what the two brothers from Dayton, Ohio—inventors, engineers, dreamers—were able to achieve. After years of designing, testing, and building the Wright Flyer in their hometown workshop, they launched it into flight from the sand dunes and wind of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on that historic day—covering 120 feet in 12 seconds and taking humankind into a new era.</FP>
    <FP>The first flight made history, but it was only the beginning. The Wright Brothers kept innovating. With every flight, they learned how to improve their techniques and their flying machine. As the flights lengthened, their acclaim grew, and they drew interest from people across our Nation and around the world. The Wright Brothers' unyielding dedication, creativity, and bravery gave birth to modern aviation—skyrocketing our Nation's leadership in flight, and inspiring generations of Americans to take to the skies.</FP>
    <FP>From Amelia Earhart's daring solo flights across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to the Tuskegee Airmen's heroic defense of our country in World War II, to brave astronauts who ventured to the Moon and beyond—America's ingenuity and innovation has continued to soar to new heights. We were the first to break the sound barrier. The first to fly non-stop around the world. Today, we are developing more sustainable fuels and energy sources for the planet, technologies to coordinate increases in air traffic, and satellite systems that can clean up manmade debris in space—and we are harnessing our resources and knowledge from decades of flight missions to take on the existential threat of climate change.</FP>
    <FP>And 118 years after the Wright Brothers' flight into history, earlier this year the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) historic Perseverance mission launched the Ingenuity rotorcraft—a small helicopter—10 feet above the surface of Mars. It was the first powered, controlled takeoff and landing on another celestial body. Tucked beneath the propellers was a small cloth taken from the wing of the original Wright Flyer, which now resides at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The ground over which Ingenuity hovered is now called Wright Brothers field—an everlasting reminder of America as the Nation of possibilities.</FP>
    <FP>
        As we continue to build our progress in flight and space technology, we honor our hard-working pilots, aircrews, astronauts, and aviation scientists that make flying possible across the globe. They represent some of the best of who we are as Americans—restless, bold, and optimistic. Thanks to the 
        <PRTPAGE P="330"/>
        tenacity and uniquely American spirit of the Wright Brothers and the pioneers who followed them, the skies are open and connecting people and communities around the world.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of each year as “Wright Brothers Day,” and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">50th Anniversary of the National Cancer Act of 1971By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Half a century ago, on December 23, 1971, policymakers, researchers, cancer survivors, and advocates gathered at the White House for the signing of the bipartisan National Cancer Act—a landmark law that has helped transform cancer research and offered hope to millions in the years since.</FP>
    <FP>For my family, and for most families, the fight against cancer is personal. As every family facing cancer does, we learned as much as we could about the illness our son Beau fought, from his diagnosis to the very end. Along the way, we came to understand just how quickly cancer-fighting science, medicine, and technology is progressing—saving more and more lives each year. It is thanks in no small part to the National Cancer Act of 1971 that so much of this progress has been possible.</FP>
    <FP>Fifty years ago, cancer screening and detection were in their infancy, treatment options were limited, and researchers worked largely in the dark. The National Cancer Act helped launch programs that form the backbone of today's cancer research enterprise by bolstering the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health; establishing NCI-designated Cancer Centers; creating national networks to conduct clinical trials; and building systems to collect, share, and advance cancer data and research.</FP>
    <FP>
        After decades of investment and innovation—and because of the limitless ingenuity of the world's finest nurses, physicians, and researchers—today we have a much more sophisticated understanding of how best to fight cancer. Thanks to new treatments and insights that could not have been imagined in generations past, the overall cancer death rate in the United States has declined steadily since the early 1990s, with more dramatic declines in the past few years.
        <PRTPAGE P="331"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Cancer touches so many families across the country. It is up to all of us to continue making progress fighting cancer and ensuring that every American has access to the quality care they need. In 2016, President Obama asked me to lead the Cancer Moonshot Initiative to end cancer as we know it, and Jill and I committed to this as one of the causes of our lives. Now, as President and First Lady, we remain committed to that mission. Today, we are more hopeful than ever about America's chances to bring an end to cancer as we know it.</FP>
    <FP>To help us get there, I have asked the Congress to launch the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health—or ARPA-H—which will invest billions of dollars to speed breakthroughs in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer and other deadly diseases. My American Rescue Plan has also expanded access to affordable health insurance coverage, ensuring that more Americans are able to receive cancer screenings and get the treatment they need without worrying about costs. My Administration will continue to build on the Affordable Care Act, so that all Americans—particularly Americans of color, Indigenous Americans, rural Americans, and others who have been historically underserved—have access to quality, affordable health care.</FP>
    <FP>As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act, I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our national commitment to accelerate cancer research and deliver hope to more families facing a cancer diagnosis. Working together, building on the decades of progress we have made, we can and will end cancer as we know it.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 23, 2021, as the 50th Anniversary of the National Cancer Act of 1971. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to redouble our pursuit of more effective and equitable access to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship care for everyone affected by cancer.</FP>

        “Commission”) to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection. Pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)), the Commission has recommended modifications to the HTS to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and the Protocol thereto (the “Convention”) and to promote uniform application of the Convention.
    </FP>
    <FP>2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if the President determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.

    <FP>12. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (USIFTA), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the “USIFTA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note)). Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning Certain Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the “2004 Agreement”)).</FP>
    <FP>
        13. In Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act and consistent with the 2004 Agreement, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. Each year from 2008 through 2020, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008; 8467 of December 23, 2009; 8618 of December 21, 2010; 8770 of December 29, 2011; 8921 of December 20, 2012; 9072 of December 23, 2013; 9223 of December 23, 2014; 9383 of December 21, 2015; 9555 of December 15, 2016; 9687 of December 22, 2017; 9834 of December 21, 2018; 9974 of December 26, 2019; and 10128 of December 22, 2020; modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period. On November 22, 2021, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2022, and to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United 
        <PRTPAGE P="336"/>
        States through the close of December 31, 2022, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.

    <FP>14. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the “USSFTA Implementation Act”) (Public Law 108-78, 117 Stat. 948, 952 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USSFTA. A technical error was made in the modifications to general note 25 to the HTS. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 25 to the HTS is necessary to provide for the intended tariff treatment accorded under the USSFTA to originating goods of Singapore.</FP>
    <FP>15. In Presidential Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, the President designated Ethiopia, the Republic of Guinea (Guinea), and the Republic of Mali (Mali) as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act, as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the “AGOA”) (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 257-58 (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1))).</FP>
    <FP>16. Section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) provides that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if the President determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act.</FP>
    <FP>17. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, I have determined that Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali do not meet the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of that Act. Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designation of Ethiopia, Guinea, and Mali as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act, effective January 1, 2022.</FP>
    <FP>
        18. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United StatesBy the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>
        1.  On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary's investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862).  The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such 
        <PRTPAGE P="339"/>
        quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.
    </FP>
    <FP>2.  In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.  Proclamation 9704 further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on aluminum articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>
    <FP>3.  In Proclamation 9710 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted the continuing discussions with the European Union (EU) on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to the national security by aluminum articles imported from the EU.  Recognizing that the EU has an important security relationship with the United States, the President determined that the necessary and appropriate means to address the threat to the national security posed by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU was to continue the ongoing discussions and to exempt aluminum articles imports from these countries from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 until May 1, 2018.  In Proclamation 9739 of April 30, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President noted that, unless the President determines by further proclamation that the United States has reached a satisfactory alternative means to remove the threatened impairment to the national security by imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU, the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 shall be effective June 1, 2018, for these countries.</FP>
    <FP>
        4.  The United States has successfully concluded discussions with the EU on behalf of its member countries on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment of the national security posed by aluminum articles imports from the EU.  The United States and the EU have agreed to expand coordination involving trade remedies and customs matters, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity, and annually review their arrangement and their ongoing cooperation.  In addition, the United States and the EU will seek to conclude, by October 31, 2023, negotiations on global steel and aluminum arrangements to restore market-oriented conditions and support the reduction of carbon intensity of steel and aluminum across modes of production.
        <PRTPAGE P="340"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>5.  The United States will implement a number of actions, including a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of aluminum articles imported into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704.  Under the arrangement, aluminum articles that area accompanied by a certificate of analysis are eligible for in-quota treatment.  In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by EU aluminum articles imports to the threatened impairment to the national security by restraining aluminum articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting transshipment, and discouraging excess aluminum capacity and production.  In light of this agreement, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 through December 31, 2023.  The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other measures agreed upon with the EU in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.</FP>
    <FP>6.  The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, align with the recommendations specified in the Secretary's report assessing the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232.  The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume, totaling 18,000 metric tons of unwrought aluminum and 366,040 metric tons of semi-finished wrought aluminum, is consistent with the objective of reaching and sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic aluminum industry.</FP>
    <FP>7.  In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9704 as applied to eligible aluminum articles imports from the EU, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries.  I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>
    <FP>8.  Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
    <FP>9.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
    <P>
        (1)  To establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of aluminum articles from member countries of the EU as described in paragraph 5 of this proclamation, U.S. note 19 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended 
        <PRTPAGE P="341"/>
        as provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.  Imports of aluminum articles from member countries of the EU in excess of the tariff-rate quota quantities shall remain subject to the duties imposed by clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended.  The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall recommend to the President, as warranted, updates to the in-quota volumes contained in the Annex to this proclamation.  Aluminum articles from a member country of the EU imported under an exclusion granted pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, shall count against the in-quota volume of the tariff-rate quota established in clause 1 of this proclamation.
    </P>
    <P>(2)  Clause 2 of Proclamation 9704, as amended, is further amended in the second sentence by deleting “and” before “(g)” and inserting before the period at the end:  “, and (h) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and except the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for aluminum articles covered by headings 9903.85.25 through 9903.85.44, inclusive.”</P>
    <P>(3)  Aluminum articles eligible for treatment under clause 1 of this proclamation must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis in order to receive such treatment.  The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to take such actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement.  Failure to comply could result in applicable remedies or penalties under United States law.</P>
    <P>(4)  The modifications made by clauses 1 through 3 of this proclamation and the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any imports of aluminum articles from the member countries of the EU that were admitted into a United States foreign trade zone in “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, shall be subject upon entry for consumption made on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, to the provisions of the tariff-rate quota in effect at the time of the entry for consumption.</P>
    <P>(6)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>
    <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.</FP>

    <FP>1.

    <FP>2.  In Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that steel articles, as defined in clause 1 of Proclamation 9705, as amended by clause 8 of Proclamation 9711 of March 22, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of those steel articles by imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico.  The proclamation further stated that any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country, and noted that, should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that the President determines that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, the President may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, adjust the tariff as it applies to other countries, as the national security interests of the United States require.</FP>

The United States will implement a number of actions, including a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of steel articles imported into the United States from the EU without the application of the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705.  Under the arrangement, steel articles that are melted and poured in the EU are eligible for in-quota treatment.  In my judgment, these measures will provide an effective, long-term alternative means to address any contribution by EU steel articles imports to the threatened impairment of the national security by restraining steel articles imports to the United States from the EU, limiting transshipment, discouraging excess steel capacity and production, and strengthening the United States-EU partnership in a fashion that will better enable future arrangements.  In light of this agreement, I have determined that specified volumes of eligible steel articles imports from the EU will no longer threaten to impair the national security and have decided to exclude such imports from the EU up to a designated quota from the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 through December 31, 2023.  The United States will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the tariff-rate quota and other measures agreed upon with the EU in addressing our national security needs, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.</FP>
    <FP>6.  The alternative means, including the tariff-rate quota, advance the recommendations contained in the Secretary's January 2018 report.  The agreed-upon aggregate tariff-rate quota volume specified in the agreement between the United States and the EU, totaling 3.3 million metric tons, is consistent with the objective of reaching and maintaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the domestic steel industry.</FP>
    <FP>7.  The United States also agreed to renew for 2 calendar years all exclusions that were granted and utilized to import steel products tariff-free from the EU in Fiscal Year 2021.  These exclusions were granted by the Department of Commerce due to a lack of domestic availability of the specified products in the United States.</FP>
    <FP>8.  In light of my determination to adjust the tariff proclaimed in Proclamation 9705 as applied to eligible steel articles imported from the EU, I have considered whether it is necessary and appropriate in light of our national security interests to make any corresponding adjustments to such tariff as it applies to other countries.  I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate, at this time, to maintain the current tariff level as it applies to other countries.</FP>

        being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.

    <FP>10.  Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
    <P>(1)  To establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of steel articles from member countries of the EU as set forth in paragraph 5 of this proclamation, U.S. Note 16 of subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is amended as provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.  Imports of steel articles from member countries of the EU in excess of the tariff-rate quota quantities shall remain subject to the duties imposed by clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended.  The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall recommend to the President, as warranted, updates to the in-quota volumes contained in the Annex to this proclamation.</P>
    <P>(2)  Clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, is revised to read as follows:</P>
    <P>“(2)(a)  In order to establish certain modifications to the duty rate on imports of steel articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation and any subsequent proclamations regarding such steel articles.</P>
    <P>
        (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, or in notices published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports covered by heading 9903.80.01, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 23, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and the member countries of the European Union; (ii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 1, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea; (iii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey; (iv) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 20, 2019, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey; (v) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 2019, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea; and (vi) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, and except the member countries of the European Union through 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on December 31, 2023, for steel articles covered by headings 9903.80.65 through 9903.81.19, inclusive.  Further, except as otherwise provided in notices 
        <PRTPAGE P="350"/>
        published pursuant to clause 3 of this proclamation, all steel articles imports from Turkey covered by heading 9903.80.02, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to a 50 percent ad valorem rate of duty with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 13, 2018, and prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 2019.  All steel articles imports covered by heading 9903.80.61, in subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS, shall be subject to the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty established herein with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern time on the date specified in a determination by the Secretary granting relief.  These rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported steel articles, shall apply to imports of steel articles from each country as specified in the preceding three sentences”.
    </P>
    <P>(3)  The first two sentences of clause 1 of Proclamation 9980 of January 24, 2020 (Adjusting Imports of Derivative Aluminum Articles and Derivative Steel Articles Into the United States), are revised to read as follows:</P>
    <P>“In order to establish increases in the duty rate on imports of certain derivative articles, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified as provided in Annex I and Annex II to this proclamation.  Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, all imports of derivative aluminum articles specified in Annex I to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty, and all imports of derivative steel articles specified in Annex II to this proclamation shall be subject to an additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty, with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, as follows: (i) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 8, 2020, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, the Commonwealth of Australia (Australia), Canada, and the United Mexican States (Mexico) and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea and; (ii) on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, these rates of duty, which are in addition to any other duties, fees, exactions, and charges applicable to such imported derivative aluminum articles or steel articles, shall apply to imports of derivative aluminum articles described in Annex I to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Canada, the member countries of the European Union and Mexico and to imports of derivative steel articles described in Annex II to this proclamation from all countries except Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the member countries of the European Union, Mexico, and South Korea.”</P>
    <P>
        (4)  Steel eligible for treatment under clause 1 of this proclamation must be melted and poured in a member country of the EU in order to receive such treatment.  The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to take such actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement.  Failure to comply could result in applicable remedies such as the 
        <PRTPAGE P="351"/>
        collection of the tariff set forth in clause 2 of Proclamation 9705, or penalties under United States law.
    </P>
    <P>(5)  Steel articles from a member country of the EU imported under an exclusion granted pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, shall not count against the in-quota volume of the tariff-rate quota established in clause 1 of this proclamation.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Secretary is directed to renew all utilized exclusions granted pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, in Fiscal Year 2021 (October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021), for the import of steel articles from one or more member countries of the EU for a period of 2 years from the date of this proclamation.  The renewed exclusions shall be for an annual volume equal to that volume imported from a member country of the EU pursuant to the exclusion in Fiscal Year 2021.  The Secretary shall communicate to U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security the exclusions and the volumes of steel articles from member countries of the EU that are allowed under this provision.  The Secretary shall, by publication on the Internet, or by other means, inform importers of the availability and volume of exclusions renewed by this provision.  This provision does not alter or modify in any way the ability of importers to seek additional exclusions in accordance with clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended, and as implemented by the Department of Commerce, for the import of steel articles from a member country of the EU.</P>
    <P>
        (7)  The Secretary shall, within 45 days of the issuance of this proclamation, publish in the 
        <E T="03">Federal Register</E>
         a notice seeking comments from interested parties on the exclusion process as set forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 705 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  Issues to be included for comment should include the responsiveness of the exclusion process to market demand and enhanced consultation with United States firms and labor organizations.  Within 60 days of the close of the comment period of the notice, the Secretary shall issue a proposed regulation revising the exclusion process as deemed appropriate following consideration of such comments.  In carrying out the review of the exclusion process, the Secretary shall review whether the criteria for review of exclusion requests in clause 3 of Proclamation 9705 that the “steel article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations” and clause 3 of Proclamation 9704 that the “aluminum article determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality and is also authorized to provide such relief based upon specific national security considerations” continues to be the appropriate criterion for making determinations.  The Secretary is authorized to make such changes to the criteria as the Secretary deems necessary and shall issue a final rule implementing such changes within 60 days of the comment period on the proposed regulation.
    </P>
    <P>
        (8)  The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as necessary, shall establish a process to assist United States steel and aluminum consumers in identifying suppliers in those trading partners with which the United States has negotiated an arrangement under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, that can provide the relevant product.
        <PRTPAGE P="352"/>
    </P>
    <P>(9)  On a regular basis, the Department of Commerce shall publish on its website the volume of steel articles imported under exclusions issued pursuant to clause 3 of Proclamation 9705, as amended.</P>
    <P>(10)  The modifications to the HTSUS made by clause 1 of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, and shall continue in effect, unless such actions are expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.</P>
    <P>(11)  Any imports of steel articles from the member countries of the EU that were admitted into a United States foreign trade zone under “privileged foreign status” as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, prior to 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, shall be subject upon entry for consumption made on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on January 1, 2022, to the provisions of the tariff-rate quota in effect at the time of the entry for consumption.</P>
    <P>(12)  Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

    <PROC>Proclamation 10329 of December 28, 2021</PROC>
    <EAR>Proc. 10329</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Revoking Proclamation 10315By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution announced that the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), constitutes a variant of concern. The WHO further reported that the number of cases of this variant appeared to be increasing in almost all provinces in the Republic of South Africa. On the same day that the WHO classified the Omicron variant as a variant of concern, and based on the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, I issued Proclamation 10315 of November 26, 2021 (Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus Disease 2019). That proclamation generally suspended and restricted the entry into the United States of noncitizens of the United States (“noncitizens”) who were physically present within the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Eswatini, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, and the Republic of Zimbabwe during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States. I took that action to slow the spread of the Omicron variant into the United States and to enable the United States to implement appropriate mitigation measures while new information emerged about the variant.</FP>
    <FP>
        Having learned more about the Omicron variant in the past several weeks, the CDC now recommends lifting the travel restrictions imposed in Proclamation 10315. Since I issued that proclamation, our Nation's health officials, in collaboration with the South African scientists who originally reported the variant, have made substantial progress in understanding the Omicron variant. Importantly, scientific experts have determined that people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 are protected against severe disease and hospitalization from the Omicron variant. Moreover, the Omicron variant has now spread to more than 100 countries, and it is prevalent in the United States. At the same time, my Administration has made international travel to the United States from all countries safer in the time since I issued Proclamation 10315. In particular, the CDC has shortened the timeline for required pre-departure COVID-19 testing for fully vaccinated travelers from no more than 3 days prior to travel to no more than 1 day. As a result, international air travelers to the United States from all countries, regardless of citizenship or vaccination status, must take a COVID-19 test within 1 day of departure and show a negative test result before they board a flight to the United States. That requirement has strengthened the already stringent international travel protocols that my Administration has imposed, including requirements for noncitizens to be fully vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions, and for travelers to wear face masks on commercial conveyances and at United States transportation hubs.
        <PRTPAGE P="364"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In light of these changed circumstances, and based on the recommendation of the CDC, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to revoke Proclamation 10315. The travel restrictions imposed by that proclamation are no longer necessary to protect the public health.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), hereby find that, except as provided in Proclamation 10294 of October 25, 2021 (Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic), or any other applicable proclamation, the unrestricted entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of Proclamation 10315 is no longer detrimental to the interests of the United States.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2022By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>Human trafficking—whether in the form of forced labor, sex trafficking, or other offenses—is an abhorrent abuse of power and a profoundly immoral crime that strikes at the safety, health, and dignity of millions of people worldwide. During National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we reaffirm our commitment to protect and empower survivors of all forms of human trafficking, to prosecute traffickers, and to bring an end to human trafficking in the United States and around the world.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration is committed to stopping human trafficking wherever it occurs. This month, we released the updated 
        <E T="03">National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking</E>
        —a whole-of-government approach to combating 
        <PRTPAGE P="366"/>
        human trafficking in the United States and abroad. The plan links anti-trafficking initiatives to our wider efforts to counter illicit financing; advance gender and racial equity; expand the rights and dignity of working people; and promote safe, orderly, and humane migration.
    </FP>
    <FP>My Administration is also dedicated to ensuring that our justice system holds accountable any individuals or entities engaged in this horrendous crime—and that our domestic and global economic systems offer no safe harbor to forced labor or other abuses. In addition to helping survivors on their road to recovery, we must also learn from their expertise in order to better detect trafficking crimes that are often hidden in plain sight, bring perpetrators to justice, and improve our prevention efforts. Since human trafficking disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, vulnerable migrants, and other historically marginalized and underserved communities, our mission to combat human trafficking must always be connected to our broader efforts to advance equity and justice across our society.</FP>
    <FP>During National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, let us resolve to counter injustice and fortify our commitment to pursue dignity and freedom for all people. The National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888) is an important resource to report a tip or ask for help.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2022 as National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. I call upon businesses, civil society organizations, communities of faith, families, and all Americans to recognize the vital role we play in combating human trafficking, and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities aimed at preventing all forms of human trafficking.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Mentoring Month, 2022By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>I often say that America can be defined in one word—possibilities. No matter our background or circumstance, every child in America has the right to go as far as their dreams will take them. But those dreams are rarely reached alone. We all benefit from the support, wisdom, and nurturing of mentors who navigated the path before us.</FP>
    <FP>
        By standing on the shoulders of mentors, young people have led America forward at each inflection point in our history. I will never forget the many 
        <PRTPAGE P="367"/>
        mentors who encouraged and empowered me as a student, as a local elected official in my twenties, and as a young United States Senator finding my way. During National Mentoring Month, we honor all those parents and family members, teachers and coaches, employers and co-workers, community and faith leaders, and so many others who devote time, care, and energy to helping our young people thrive.
    </FP>
    <FP>As we continue to build back from the pandemic, my Administration is making unprecedented investments to set the next generation up for success. Earlier this year, the Department of Labor awarded $89 million through its YouthBuild program and over $20 million through its Workforce Pathways for Youth programs to dedicated mentors who share their wisdom and experience and provide employment and counseling services to young people. We also proudly support initiatives across our executive departments and agencies that provide tutoring, community service opportunities, school-based and after-school programs, summer learning and enrichment, and work-based learning opportunities.</FP>
    <FP>As advocate and activist Marian Wright Edelman said, “It is the responsibility of every adult—especially parents, educators, and religious leaders—to make sure that children hear what we have learned from the lessons of life and to hear over and over that we love them and that they are not alone.” Mentorship is vital to fulfilling this responsibility, expanding opportunity, and helping our children fulfill their God-given potential.</FP>
    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2022 as National Mentoring Month. I call upon Americans across the country to observe this month with mentoring, appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">National Stalking Awareness Month, 2022By the President of the United States of America</HD>
    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
    <FP>All people deserve to feel safe and protected—whether in their home, at work or school, online, or in any other public or private spaces. During National Stalking Awareness Month, we support all those who are threatened and harmed by the pervasive crime of stalking, recognize those who raise awareness and advocate for survivors, and recommit to eradicating stalking nationwide.</FP>
    <FP>
        Stalkers employ multiple tactics to instill fear, intimidate, surveil, and exert control over the people they target. Studies show that 1 in 6 women 
        <PRTPAGE P="368"/>
        and 1 in 17 men have been subjected to stalking in their lifetime, the majority of whom were threatened by someone they know—often a current or former intimate partner. Survivors often suffer physical, psychological, and social harms, such as higher than average rates of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Stalking also can take a serious economic toll, as those who are stalked may have to uproot their lives at their own expense to evade their stalkers, or take unpaid time off from work in order to protect themselves and their families.
    </FP>
    <FP>In recent years, the most prevalent form of stalking crimes has involved the use of smartphones, computers, and other devices. With schools, workplaces, and social interactions relying on virtual platforms, the risk of stalking has grown considerably. As technology continues to advance, we must ensure that all people—especially women, girls, and LGBTQI+ individuals who are at greatest risk—can engage in online spaces freely and safely. We must also seek accountability for individuals or systems that perpetrate or enable stalking.</FP>
    <FP>Given the disproportionate impact of stalking and other forms of digital abuse on women and girls, my Administration's National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality includes a commitment to launch a task force to address online harassment and abuse. This task force will be specifically focused on technology-facilitated, gender-based violence and will be charged with developing concrete recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection efforts domestically and worldwide.</FP>
    <FP>The task force will seek input from survivors, advocates, law enforcement professionals, civil and human rights groups, technology platforms, and other experts to ensure that those with expertise and lived experiences are able to directly inform these recommendations. My Administration has also committed to developing the first-ever National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, which will further our efforts to prevent and respond to stalking and other forms of gender-based violence.</FP>
    <FP>This effort has been one of the central causes of my career. To address these abuses of power—stalking, domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault—I wrote and championed the Violence Against Women Act nearly three decades ago to begin to change our culture and ensure that survivors of these appalling crimes receive the services and support they need. Through the years, I have worked to reauthorize the Act several times—each time expanding its protections. Now, I am calling on the Congress to once again reauthorize and modernize this landmark legislation with enhanced provisions to expand the way our country responds to and prevents stalking and other forms of gender-based violence.</FP>
    <FP>Stalking operates in the shadows and is fueled by silence and inaction. As we begin this new year, let us commit to shining a brighter light on this insidious crime, to broadening our support for those affected, and to ensuring that all people can live in a world free from violence and fear.</FP>
    <FP>
        NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2022 as National Stalking Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to speak out against stalking and to support the efforts of advocates, courts, service providers, and law enforcement to help those who are targeted and send the message to perpetrators that this crime will not go unpunished.

    <FP>
        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
    </FP>
    <FP>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that additional steps must be taken to deal with the national emergency with respect to the information and communications technology and services supply chain declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain). Specifically, the pace and pervasiveness of the spread in the United States of certain connected mobile and desktop applications and other software developed or controlled by persons in the People's Republic of China, to include Hong Kong and Macau (China), continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by these Chinese connected software applications.</FP>
    <FP>By accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information. This data collection threatens to provide the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with access to Americans' personal and proprietary information—which would permit China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, and build dossiers of personal information.</FP>
    <FP>
        The continuing activity of the PRC and the CCP to steal or otherwise obtain United States persons' data makes clear that there is an intent to use bulk data collection to advance China's economic and national security agenda. For example, the 2014 cyber intrusions of the Office of Personnel Management of security clearance records of more than 21 million people were orchestrated by Chinese agents. In 2015, a Chinese hacking group breached 
        <PRTPAGE P="372"/>
        the United States health insurance company Anthem, affecting more than 78 million Americans. And the Department of Justice indicted members of the Chinese military for the 2017 Equifax cyber intrusion that compromised the personal information of almost half of all Americans.
    </FP>
    <FP>In light of these risks, many executive departments and agencies (agencies) have prohibited the use of Chinese connected software applications and other dangerous software on Federal Government computers and mobile phones. These prohibitions, however, are not enough given the nature of the threat from Chinese connected software applications. In fact, the Government of India has banned the use of more than 200 Chinese connected software applications throughout the country; in a statement, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that the applications were “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.”</FP>
    <FP>The United States has assessed that a number of Chinese connected software applications automatically capture vast swaths of information from millions of users in the United States, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information, which would allow the PRC and CCP access to Americans' personal and proprietary information.</FP>
    <FP>The United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control Chinese connected software applications to protect our national security.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby order:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Small Modular Reactors for National Defense and Space Exploration</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         Nuclear energy is critical to United States national security. That is why I have taken a series of actions to promote its development and facilitate its use. On June 29, 2017, I announced an initiative to revive and expand the nuclear energy sector and directed a complete review of United States nuclear energy policy to help find new ways to revitalize this crucial energy resource. On July 12, 2019, I signed a Presidential Memorandum entitled “The Effect of Uranium Imports on the National Security and Establishment of the United States Nuclear Fuel Working Group,” with the goal of examining the current state of domestic nuclear fuel production and reinvigorating the nuclear fuel supply chain, consistent with United States national security and nonproliferation goals. On August 20, 2019, I signed National Security Presidential Memorandum-20, entitled “Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” calling for development and use of space nuclear systems to enable or enhance space exploration and operational capabilities.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        The purpose of this order is to take an important additional step to revitalize the United States nuclear energy sector, reinvigorate America's space exploration program, and develop diverse energy options for national defense needs. Under this action, the United States Government will coordinate its nuclear activities to apply the benefits of nuclear energy most effectively toward American technology supremacy, including the use of small modular reactors for national defense and space exploration. This work is critical to advancing my Administration's priorities for the United States to lead in research, technology, invention, innovation, and advanced technology development; its mission to promote and protect the United States national security innovation base; its drive to secure energy dominance; and its commitment to achieving all of these goals in a manner consistent with the highest nuclear nonproliferation standards.
        <PRTPAGE P="375"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The United States was the first nation to invent and develop the technology to harness nuclear energy. Since the 1950s, the United States Navy has been operating and advancing transportable nuclear reactors, resulting in powerfully enhanced marine propulsion for its aircraft carriers and allowing nuclear-powered submarines to remain submerged for extended periods of time.</FP>
    <FP>The United States must sustain its ability to meet the energy requirements for its national defense and space exploration initiatives. The ability to use small modular reactors will help maintain and advance United States dominance and strategic leadership across the space and terrestrial domains.</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         It is the policy of the United States to promote advanced reactor technologies, including small modular reactors, to support defense installation energy flexibility and energy security, and for use in space exploration, guided by the following principles:
    </FP>
    <P>(a) A healthy and robust nuclear energy industry is critical to the national security, energy security, and economic prosperity of the United States;</P>
    <P>(b) The United States should maintain technology supremacy for nuclear research and development, manufacturing proficiency, and security and safety; and</P>
    <P>(c) The United States Government should bolster national defense and space exploration capabilities and enable private-sector innovation of advanced reactor technologies.</P>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Demonstration of Commercial Reactors to Enhance Energy Flexibility at a Defense Installation.</E>
         (a) Micro-reactors have the potential to enhance energy flexibility and energy security at domestic military installations in remote locations. Accordingly, the Secretary of Defense shall, within 180 days of the date of this order, establish and implement a plan to demonstrate the energy flexibility capability and cost effectiveness of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission-licensed micro-reactor at a domestic military installation.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) If the demonstration is successful, the Secretary of Defense shall identify opportunities at domestic military installations where this capability could enhance or supplement the fulfillment of installation energy requirements. In identifying these opportunities, the Secretary of Defense shall take into account considerations that are unique to national defense needs and requirements that may not be relevant in the private sector, such as:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) the ability to provide resilient, independent energy delivery to installations in the event that connections to an electrical grid are compromised;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) the ability to operate for an extended period of time without refueling;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) system resistance to disruption from an electro-magnetic pulse event; and</FP>

        <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Defense Capabilities.</E>
         (a) The Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the world, using more than 10 million gallons of fuel per day and 30,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year, nearly all of which is provided through civilian electrical grids. Fuel demands for a modern United States military have dramatically grown since World War II and are anticipated to continue to increase in order to support high-energy-usage military systems. In this context, nuclear power could significantly enhance national defense power capabilities.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) The Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA Administrator):</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) determine whether advanced nuclear reactors can be made to benefit Department of Defense future space power needs;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) pilot a transportable micro-reactor prototype;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) direct an analysis of alternatives for personnel, regulatory, and technical requirements to inform future decisions with respect to nuclear power usage; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) direct an analysis of United States military uses for space nuclear power and propulsion technologies and an analysis of foreign adversaries' space power and propulsion programs.</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Space Exploration.</E>
         (a) Nuclear power sources that use uranium fuel or plutonium heat sources are essential to deep space exploration and in areas where solar power is not practical. NASA uses radioisotope power systems, such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units, to provide power and heat for deep space robotic missions. Nuclear power sources in the kilowatt range may be needed for demonstrating In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and robotic exploration of permanently shadowed craters on the Moon that contain frozen water. Nuclear reactors up to 100 kilowatts may be needed to support human habitats, ISRU, other facilities, and rovers on both the Moon and Mars. Power sources in the megawatt range would be necessary for efficient, long-duration deep space propulsion. Affordable, lightweight nuclear power sources in space would enable new opportunities for scientific discovery. The sustainable exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other locations will be enhanced if small modular reactors can be deployed and operated remotely from Earth.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the NASA Administrator, in consultation with heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), as appropriate, shall define requirements for NASA utilization of nuclear energy systems for human and robotic exploration missions through 2040 and analyze the costs and benefits of such requirements. In defining these requirements, the NASA Administrator shall take into account considerations unique to the utilization of nuclear energy systems in space, such as:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) transportability of a reactor prior to and after deployment;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) thermal management in a reduced- or zero-gravity environment in a vacuum or near-vacuum;</FP>

        . 
        <E T="03">Domestic Fuel Supply.</E>
         (a) A thriving and secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain is critical to the national interests of the United States. A viable domestic nuclear fuel supply chain not only supports defense and national security activities, but also enables the success of the commercial nuclear industry. Many advanced reactor concepts, however, will require high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), for which no domestic commercial enrichment capability currently exists. The United States must take steps to ensure a viable United States-origin HALEU supply.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) The Secretary of Energy shall complete the Department of Energy's ongoing 3-year, $115 million demonstration of a United States-origin enrichment technology capable of producing HALEU for use in defense-related advanced reactor applications. Within funding available for the demonstration project, the Secretary of Energy should develop a plan to promote successful transition of this technology to the private sector for commercial adoption.</P>
    <P>(c) The Secretary of Energy shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the NASA Administrator regarding how advanced fuels and related technologies can best support implementation of sections 3, 4, and 5 of this order.</P>

        <E T="03">Common Technology Roadmap.</E>
         (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and the NASA Administrator shall develop a common technology roadmap through 2030 that describes potential development programs and that coordinates, to the extent practicable, terrestrial-based advanced nuclear reactor and space-based nuclear power and propulsion efforts. Agencies shall remain responsible for funding their respective mission-unique requirements. The roadmap shall also include, at a minimum:
    </FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) assessments of foreign nations' space nuclear power and propulsion technological capabilities;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) pathways for transitioning technologies developed through Federally supported programs to private-sector activities; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) other applications supporting the goals provided in section 1 of this order.</FP>
    <P>
        (b) The roadmap shall be submitted to the President by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Executive Secretary of

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing the Wildland Fire Management Policy Committee</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         Federal wildland fire management lacks a single focal point of responsibility for policy leadership and accountability for cost controls. While executive departments and agencies (agencies) have implemented Executive Order 13855 of December 21, 2018 (Promoting Active Management of America's Forests, Rangelands, and Other Federal Lands To Improve Conditions and Reduce Wildfire Risk), and similar Administration efforts, more must be done to continue to improve interagency coordination.
    </FP>
    <FP>In contrast to effective ground-level coordination with States, including at the National Interagency Fire Center on suppression activity and the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC) on Federal-State policy coordination, agencies do not adequately or effectively coordinate with each other at the policy level to reduce hazardous fuels and wildfire severity. This order will ensure that agencies effectively work together in coordinating Federal wildland fire management policy to improve funding allocations for hazardous fuel projects, performance measures for suppression operations and hazardous fuels mitigation, procurement, Federal-State cooperation and cost sharing, cross-jurisdictional post-wildfire rehabilitation, monitoring of electric transmission lines and other critical infrastructure, and other functions.</FP>

    <P>(b) Reduce unnecessary duplication across the Federal Government by coordinating and consolidating existing wildland fire-related councils, working groups, and other formal cross-agency initiatives, as appropriate;</P>
    <P>(c) Efficiently and effectively manage preparedness resources, initial attack response, extended attack and large-fire support, post-wildfire rehabilitation, and hazardous fuels at a cross-boundary, landscape scale;</P>
    <P>(d) Promote integrated planning and procurement among agencies for Federal investments in wildland fire management infrastructure;</P>
    <P>(e) Support workforce development and efforts to recruit, train, and retain Federal wildland firefighters to efficiently and effectively respond to wildfire on public lands, and to protect life, property, and community infrastructure; and</P>

    <P>(c) Developing and adopting additional wildland fire suppression operations performance measures for large wildfires, and for aviation asset deployment, that go beyond the traditional output reporting of acres burned, dollars spent, and gallons of retardant dropped to demonstrate strategic use of high-cost human capital, equipment, and aircraft as opposed to traditional reliance on overwhelming force;</P>
    <P>(d) Developing and adopting new technologies to bring to bear cutting-edge management of the wildland fire program to improve the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of suppression operations;</P>
    <P>(e) Developing and adopting data-driven decision-making in order to support infrastructure, allowing for better integration of wildland fire research and development into ground-level suppression operations and hazardous fuel mitigation;</P>

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         Under the Constitution and Federal law, our Government vests in judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers the power to make decisions of enormous consequence. Because of the importance of their work, these public servants face unique risks to their safety and the safety of their families. Some who face or have received an adverse judicial decision have sought to intimidate or punish judges and prosecutors with threats of harm. Moreover, judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers are symbols within our communities of law and order and may be targeted for that reason alone. And at times, family members of public servants have become victims. Last year, a former litigant before a Federal judge in New Jersey tragically murdered the judge's 20-year-old son and critically wounded her husband. Judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers' resiliency in the face of the danger they regularly face is an inspiration for all of us in public service.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers should not have to choose between public service and subjecting themselves and their families to danger. My Administration has no higher priorities than preserving the 
        <PRTPAGE P="387"/>
        rule of law in our country and protecting the men and women who serve under its flag. Accordingly, I am ordering enhanced protections for judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers. Federal law already allows Federal and State law enforcement officers to protect themselves by carrying a concealed firearm, but the Federal Government can do more to cut the red tape that Federal law enforcement officers must navigate to exercise their right. The current threat to Federal prosecutors also demands an expansion of their ability to carry a concealed firearm, as allowed under the Department of Justice's existing authorities. Finally, the Congress should act expeditiously to adopt legislation extending the right to carry a concealed firearm to Federal judges and pass other measures that will expand our capacity to combat threats of violence against judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers.

    <EAR>EO 13978</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Building the National Garden of American Heroes</HD>
    <FP>
        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
        <PRTPAGE P="390"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Background.</E>
         In Executive Order 13934 of July 3, 2020 (Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes), I made it the policy of the United States to establish a statuary park named the National Garden of American Heroes (National Garden). To begin the process of building this new monument to our country's greatness, I established the Interagency Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes (Task Force) and directed its members to plan for construction of the National Garden. The Task Force has advised me it has completed the first phase of its work and is prepared to move forward. This order revises Executive Order 13934 and provides additional direction for the Task Force.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         The chronicles of our history show that America is a land of heroes. As I announced during my address at Mount Rushmore, the gates of a beautiful new garden will soon open to the public where the legends of America's past will be remembered.
    </FP>
    <FP>The National Garden will be built to reflect the awesome splendor of our country's timeless exceptionalism. It will be a place where citizens, young and old, can renew their vision of greatness and take up the challenge that I gave every American in my first address to Congress, to “[b]elieve in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.”</FP>
    <FP>Across this Nation, belief in the greatness and goodness of America has come under attack in recent months and years by a dangerous anti-American extremism that seeks to dismantle our country's history, institutions, and very identity. The heroes of 1776 have been desecrated, with statues of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin vandalized and toppled. The dead who gave their lives to end slavery and save the Union during the Civil War have been dishonored, with monuments to Abraham Lincoln, Hans Christian Heg, and the courageous 54th Regiment left damaged and disfigured. The brave warriors who saved freedom from Nazi fascism have been disgraced with a memorial to World War II veterans defaced with the hammer and sickle of Soviet communism.</FP>
    <FP>The National Garden is America's answer to this reckless attempt to erase our heroes, values, and entire way of life. On its grounds, the devastation and discord of the moment will be overcome with abiding love of country and lasting patriotism. This is the American way. When the forces of anti-Americanism have sought to burn, tear down, and destroy, patriots have built, rebuilt, and lifted up. That is our history. America responded to the razing of the White House by building it back in the same place with unbroken resolve, to the murders of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr., with a national temple and the Stone of Hope, and to the terrorism of 9/11 with a new Freedom Tower. In keeping with this tradition, America is responding to the tragic toppling of monuments to our founding generation and the giants of our past by commencing a new national project for their restoration, veneration, and celebration.</FP>
    <FP>
        The National Garden will draw together and fix in the soil of a single place what Abraham Lincoln called “[t]he mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart.” In the peace and harmony of this vast outdoor park, visitors will come and learn the amazing stories of some of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. The National Garden will feature a roll call of heroes who deserve honor, recognition, and lasting tribute because of the battles they won, the ideas they 
        <PRTPAGE P="391"/>
        championed, the diseases they cured, the lives they saved, the heights they achieved, and the hope they passed down to all of us—that united as one American people trusting in God, there is no challenge that cannot be overcome and no dream that is beyond our reach.
    </FP>
    <FP>In short, each individual has been chosen for embodying the American spirit of daring and defiance, excellence and adventure, courage and confidence, loyalty and love. Astounding the world by the sheer power of their example, each one of them has contributed indispensably to America's noble history, the best chapters of which are still to come.</FP>

        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         American democracy operates on the principle of the consent of the governed. Regular elections for the Congress and the President and Vice President of the United States are designed to ensure that the officials responsible for making and executing the law are held accountable to the American people. The President chooses Federal agency heads who exercise executive authority and implement his regulatory agenda. The American people, in electing the President, thereby have a role in choosing the individuals who govern them.
    </FP>
    <FP>However, some agencies have chosen to blur these lines of democratic accountability by allowing career officials to authorize, approve, and serve as the final word on regulations. This practice transfers the power to set rules governing Americans' daily lives from the President, acting through his executive subordinates, to officials insulated from the accountability that national elections bring. This practice undermines the power of the American people to choose who governs them and I am directing steps to end it.</FP>

         In the interest of fairness, Federal criminal law should be clearly written so that all Americans can understand what is prohibited and act accordingly. Some statutes have authorized executive branch agencies to promulgate thousands of regulations, creating a thicket of requirements that can be difficult to navigate, and many of these regulations are enforceable through criminal processes and penalties. The purpose of this order is to alleviate regulatory burdens on Americans by ensuring that they have notice of potential criminal liability for violations of regulations and by focusing criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses on the most culpable individuals.

Two common mental states are “knowingly” and “willfully.” A defendant acts “knowingly” with respect to an element of the offense if he or she has knowledge of the essential facts comprising that element. In addition, a defendant “willfully” violates a statute if he or she acts with a “bad purpose” that is with “knowledge that his [or her] conduct is unlawful.” Model Criminal Jury Instructions (3d Cir. 2018), ch. 5, sec. 5.02 cmt.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Protecting the United States From Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,</FP>
    <FP>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that additional actions are necessary to ensure the security of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) owned, operated, and controlled by the Federal Government; to secure the integrity of American infrastructure, including America's National Airspace System (NAS); to protect our law enforcement and warfighters; and to maintain and expand our domestic industrial base capabilities.</FP>

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         UAS have tremendous potential to support public safety and national security missions and are increasingly being used by Federal, State, and local governments. UAS are used, for example, to assist law enforcement and support natural disaster relief efforts. Reliance on UAS and components manufactured by our adversaries, however, threatens our national and economic security.
    </FP>
    <FP>United States Government operations involving UAS require accessing, collecting, and maintaining data, which could reveal sensitive information. The use of UAS and critical components manufactured and developed by foreign adversaries, or by persons under their control, may allow this sensitive information to be accessed by or transferred to foreign adversaries. Furthermore, the manufacturing of UAS involves combining several critical components, including advanced manufacturing techniques, artificial intelligence, microelectronic components, and multi-spectral sensors. The Nation's capability to produce UAS and certain critical UAS components domestically is critical for national defense and the security and strength of our defense industrial base.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of the United States, therefore, to prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to procure UAS that present unacceptable risks and are manufactured by, or contain software or critical electronic components from, foreign adversaries, and to encourage the use of domestically produced UAS.</FP>

    <FP>
        I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that additional steps must be taken to deal with the national emergency related to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities declared in Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015 (Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities), as amended, to address the use of United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products by foreign malicious cyber actors. IaaS products provide persons the ability to run software and store data on servers offered for rent or lease without responsibility for the maintenance and operating costs of those servers. Foreign malicious cyber actors aim to harm the United States economy through the theft of intellectual property and sensitive data and to threaten national security by targeting United States critical infrastructure for malicious cyber-enabled activities. Foreign actors use United States IaaS products for a variety of tasks in carrying out malicious cyber-enabled activities, which makes it extremely difficult for United States officials to track and 
        <PRTPAGE P="404"/>
        obtain information through legal process before these foreign actors transition to replacement infrastructure and destroy evidence of their prior activities; foreign resellers of United States IaaS products make it easier for foreign actors to access these products and evade detection. This order provides authority to impose record-keeping obligations with respect to foreign transactions. To address these threats, to deter foreign malicious cyber actors' use of United States IaaS products, and to assist in the investigation of transactions involving foreign malicious cyber actors, the United States must ensure that providers offering United States IaaS products verify the identity of persons obtaining an IaaS account (“Account”) for the provision of these products and maintain records of those transactions. In appropriate circumstances, to further protect against malicious cyber-enabled activities, the United States must also limit certain foreign actors' access to United States IaaS products. Further, the United States must encourage more robust cooperation among United States IaaS providers, including by increasing voluntary information sharing, to bolster efforts to thwart the actions of foreign malicious cyber actors.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country's greatest strengths. But for too many, the American Dream remains out of reach. Entrenched disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions, have often denied that equal opportunity to individuals and communities. Our country faces converging economic, health, and climate crises that have exposed and exacerbated inequities, while a historic movement for justice has highlighted the unbearable human costs of systemic racism. Our Nation deserves an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda that matches the scale of the opportunities and challenges that we face.
        <PRTPAGE P="410"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government. Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity.</FP>
    <FP>By advancing equity across the Federal Government, we can create opportunities for the improvement of communities that have been historically underserved, which benefits everyone. For example, an analysis shows that closing racial gaps in wages, housing credit, lending opportunities, and access to higher education would amount to an additional $5 trillion in gross domestic product in the American economy over the next 5 years. The Federal Government's goal in advancing equity is to provide everyone with the opportunity to reach their full potential. Consistent with these aims, each agency must assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups. Such assessments will better equip agencies to develop policies and programs that deliver resources and benefits equitably to all.</FP>

        <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
         For purposes of this order: (a) The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) The term “underserved communities” refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of “equity.”</P>

        <E T="03">Role of the Domestic Policy Council.</E>
         The role of the White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC) is to coordinate the formulation and implementation of my Administration's domestic policy objectives. Consistent with this role, the DPC will coordinate efforts to embed equity principles, policies, and approaches across the Federal Government. This will include efforts to remove systemic barriers to and provide equal access to opportunities and benefits, identify communities the Federal Government has underserved, and develop policies designed to advance equity for those communities. The DPC-led interagency process will ensure that these efforts are made in coordination with the directors of the National Security Council and the National Economic Council.

The study should aim to identify the best methods, consistent with applicable law, to assist agencies in assessing equity with respect to race, ethnicity, religion, income, geography, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) As part of this study, the Director of OMB shall consider whether to recommend that agencies employ pilot programs to test model assessment tools and assist agencies in doing so.</P>

         The head of each agency, or designee, shall, in consultation with the Director of OMB, select certain of the agency's programs and policies for a review that will assess whether underserved communities and their members face systemic barriers in accessing benefits and opportunities available pursuant to those policies and programs. The head of each agency, or designee, shall conduct such review and within 200 days of the date of this order provide a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy (APDP) reflecting findings on the following:

    <EAR>EO 13986</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Ensuring a Lawful and Accurate Enumeration and Apportionment Pursuant to the Decennial Census</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04"> Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Background.</E>
         We have long guaranteed all of the Nation's inhabitants representation in the House of Representatives. This tradition is foundational to our representative democracy, for our elected representatives have a responsibility to represent the interests of all people residing in the United States and affected by our laws. This tradition also respects the dignity and humanity of every person. Accordingly, the executive branch has always determined the population of each State, for purposes of congressional representation, without regard to whether its residents are in lawful immigration status.
    </FP>
    <FP>The census and apportionment processes are enshrined in the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment apportions seats in the House of Representatives “among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.” (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 2.) Article I, in turn, provides that, in order to determine those numbers, an “actual Enumeration” of the population of the United States must be conducted every 10 years. (U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 2, cl. 3.) The Congress has assigned responsibility for conducting the decennial census to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). (13 U.S.C. 141(a).)</FP>
    <FP>Once the Secretary, through the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, takes the count, the President must carry out the apportionment of Representatives among the States. The Secretary prepares the “tabulation of total population by States . . . as required for the apportionment of Representatives,” and reports that tabulation to the President. (13 U.S.C. 141(b).) The President then sends a statement to the Congress showing “the whole number of persons in each State,” as ascertained under the census, and “the number of Representatives to which each State would be entitled under” the equal proportions apportionment method. (2 U.S.C. 2a(a).) The Clerk of the House of Representatives then transmits to each State a certification of the number of seats that the State receives under that apportionment. (2 U.S.C. 2a(b).) Finally, within 1 year of the decennial census date, the Secretary must also report to the Governor and officers or public bodies having responsibility for legislative apportionment or districting of each State the population tabulations to be used for apportioning districts within that State. (13 U.S.C. 141(c).)</FP>
    <FP>
        At no point since our Nation's Founding has a person's immigration status alone served as a basis for excluding that person from the total population count used in apportionment. Before the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the Constitution did not give equal weight to every person counted under the census. (U.S. Const. art. 1, sec. 2.) In accord with constitutional and statutory requirements, however, every apportionment since ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment has calculated each State's share of Representatives based on “the whole number of persons in each State,” excluding only “Indians not taxed”—an express constitutional exception that no longer has legal or practical effect. (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 2; 2 
        <PRTPAGE P="415"/>
        U.S.C. 2a(a).) The term “persons in each State” has always been understood to include every person whose usual place of residence was in that State as of the designated census date. (
        <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E>
         Act of Mar. 1, 1790, ch. 2, secs. 1, 5, 1 Stat. 101, 103; 
        <E T="03">Franklin</E>
         v. 
        <E T="03">Massachusetts,</E>
         505 U.S. 788, 804 (1992).) This unbroken practice has ensured that “the basis of representation in the House” is “every individual of the community at large.” (
        <E T="03">Evenwel</E>
         v. 
        <E T="03">Abbott,</E>
         136 S. Ct. 1120, 1127 (2016) (emphasis and quotation marks omitted).) And it reflects a sound policy judgment that the apportionment base be both clear and insulated against manipulation designed to affect the balance of power among the States.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        During the 2020 Census, the President announced a policy that broke from this long tradition. It aimed to produce a different apportionment base—one that would, to the maximum extent feasible, exclude persons who are not in a lawful immigration status. 
        <E T="03">See</E>
         Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 2020 (Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census). This policy conflicted with the principle of equal representation enshrined in our Constitution, census statutes, and historical tradition. The policy further required the Census Bureau to inappropriately rely on records related to immigration status that were likely to be incomplete and inaccurate.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04"> Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Both the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and section 2a(a) of title 2, United States Code, require that the apportionment base of each State, for the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the decennial census, include all persons whose usual place of residence was in that State as of the designated census date, regardless of their immigration status. These laws, affirmed by the executive branch's longstanding historical practice, do not permit the exclusion of inhabitants of the United States from the apportionment base solely on the ground that they lack a lawful immigration status. Reflecting this legal background, and the values of equal representation and respect that the Constitution and laws embody, it is the policy of the United States that reapportionment shall be based on the total number of persons residing in the several States, without regard for immigration status. It is likewise essential that the census count be accurate and based on reliable and high-quality data.

         In preparing the report to the President required under section 141(b) of title 13, United States Code, the Secretary shall report the tabulation of total population by State that reflects the whole number of persons whose usual residence was in each State as of the designated census date in section 141(a) of title 13, United States Code, without regard to immigration status. In addition, the Secretary shall use tabulations of population reflecting the whole number of persons whose usual residence was in each State as of the census date, without regard to immigration status, in reports provided to the Governor and officers or public bodies having responsibility for legislative apportionment or districting of each State under section 141(c) of title 13, United States Code.

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love. Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports. Adults should be able to earn a living and pursue a vocation knowing that they will not be fired, demoted, or mistreated because of whom they go home to or because how they dress does not conform to sex-based stereotypes. People should be able to access healthcare and secure a roof over their heads without being subjected to sex discrimination. All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        These principles are reflected in the Constitution, which promises equal protection of the laws. These principles are also enshrined in our Nation's anti-discrimination laws, among them Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ). In 
        <E T="03">Bostock</E>
         v. 
        <E T="03">Clayton County,</E>
         590 U.S._(2020), the Supreme Court held that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination “because of . . . sex” covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. Under 
        <E T="03">Bostock's</E>
         reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), the Fair Housing Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), and section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1522), along with their respective implementing regulations—prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.
    </FP>
    <FP>Discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation manifests differently for different individuals, and it often overlaps with other forms of prohibited discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race or disability. For example, transgender Black Americans face unconscionably high levels of workplace discrimination, homelessness, and violence, including fatal violence.</FP>

         Our Nation has an abiding commitment to empower our workers and communities; promote and protect our public health and the environment; and conserve our national treasures and monuments, places that secure our national memory. Where the Federal Government has failed to meet that commitment in the past, it must advance environmental justice. In carrying out this charge, the Federal Government must be guided by the best science and be protected by processes that ensure the integrity of Federal decision-making. It is, therefore, the policy of my Administration to listen to the science; to improve public health and protect our environment; to ensure access to clean air and water; to limit exposure to dangerous chemicals and pesticides; to hold polluters accountable, including those who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities; to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; to bolster resilience to the impacts of climate change; to restore and expand our national treasures and monuments; and to prioritize both environmental justice and the creation of the well-paying union jobs necessary to deliver on these goals.
    </FP>
    <FP>To that end, this order directs all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to immediately review and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, take action to address the promulgation of Federal regulations and other actions during the last 4 years that conflict with these important national objectives, and to immediately commence work to confront the climate crisis.</FP>

         (a) It is essential that agencies capture the full costs of greenhouse gas emissions as accurately as possible, including by taking global damages into account. Doing so facilitates sound decision-making, recognizes the breadth of climate impacts, and supports the international leadership of the United States on climate issues. The “social cost of carbon” (SCC), “social cost of nitrous oxide” (SCN), and “social cost of methane” (SCM) are estimates of the monetized damages associated with incremental increases in greenhouse gas emissions. They are intended to include changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services. An accurate social cost is essential for agencies to accurately determine the social benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions when conducting cost-benefit analyses of regulatory and other actions.

    <P>(b) There is hereby established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (the “Working Group”).

         (a) On March 29, 2019, the President granted to TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. a Presidential permit (the “Permit”) to construct, connect, operate, and maintain pipeline facilities at the international border of the United States and Canada (the “Keystone XL pipeline”), subject to express conditions and potential revocation in the President's sole discretion. The Permit is hereby revoked in accordance with Article 1(1) of the Permit.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) In 2015, following an exhaustive review, the Department of State and the President determined that approving the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would not serve the U.S. national interest. That analysis, in addition to concluding that the significance of the proposed pipeline for our energy security and economy is limited, stressed that the United States must prioritize the development of a clean energy economy, which will in turn create good jobs. The analysis further concluded that approval of the proposed pipeline would undermine U.S. climate leadership by undercutting the credibility and influence of the United States in urging other countries to take ambitious climate action.</P>
    <P>
        (c) Climate change has had a growing effect on the U.S. economy, with climate-related costs increasing over the last 4 years. Extreme weather events and other climate-related effects have harmed the health, safety, and security of the American people and have increased the urgency for combatting climate change and accelerating the transition toward a clean energy economy. The world must be put on a sustainable climate pathway 
        <PRTPAGE P="433"/>
        to protect Americans and the domestic economy from harmful climate impacts, and to create well-paying union jobs as part of the climate solution.
    </P>
    <P>(d) The Keystone XL pipeline disserves the U.S. national interest. The United States and the world face a climate crisis. That crisis must be met with action on a scale and at a speed commensurate with the need to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory. At home, we will combat the crisis with an ambitious plan to build back better, designed to both reduce harmful emissions and create good clean-energy jobs. Our domestic efforts must go hand in hand with U.S. diplomatic engagement. Because most greenhouse gas emissions originate beyond our borders, such engagement is more necessary and urgent than ever. The United States must be in a position to exercise vigorous climate leadership in order to achieve a significant increase in global climate action and put the world on a sustainable climate pathway. Leaving the Keystone XL pipeline permit in place would not be consistent with my Administration's economic and climate imperatives.</P>

The task of enforcing the immigration laws is complex and requires setting priorities to best serve the national interest. The policy of my Administration is to protect national and border security, address the humanitarian challenges at the southern border, and ensure public health and safety. We must also adhere to due process of law as we safeguard the dignity and well-being of all families and communities.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to address the disproportionate and severe impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on communities of color and other underserved populations, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated severe and pervasive health and social inequities in America. For instance, people of color experience systemic and structural racism in many facets of our society and are more likely to become sick and die from COVID-19. The lack of complete data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates, as well as underlying health and social vulnerabilities, has further hampered efforts to ensure an equitable pandemic response. Other communities, often obscured in the data, are also disproportionately affected by COVID-19, including sexual and gender minority groups, those living with disabilities, and those living at the margins of our economy. Observed inequities in rural and Tribal communities, territories, and other geographically isolated communities require a place-based approach to data collection and the response. Despite increased State and local efforts to address these inequities, COVID-19's disparate impact on communities of color and other underserved populations remains unrelenting.
        <PRTPAGE P="443"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Addressing this devastating toll is both a moral imperative and pragmatic policy. It is impossible to change the course of the pandemic without tackling it in the hardest-hit communities. In order to identify and eliminate health and social inequities resulting in disproportionately higher rates of exposure, illness, and death, I am directing a Government-wide effort to address health equity. The Federal Government must take swift action to prevent and remedy differences in COVID-19 care and outcomes within communities of color and other underserved populations.</FP>

         Science-based public health measures are critical to preventing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by travelers within the United States and those who enter the country from abroad. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Surgeon General, and the National Institutes of Health have concluded that mask-wearing, physical distancing, appropriate ventilation, and timely testing can mitigate the risk of travelers spreading COVID-19. Accordingly, to save lives and allow all Americans, including the millions of people employed in the transportation industry, to travel and work safely, it is the policy of my Administration to implement these public health measures consistent with CDC guidelines on public modes of transportation and at ports of entry to the United States.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, to ensure that students receive a high-quality education during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to support the safe reopening and continued operation of schools, child care providers, Head Start programs, and institutions of higher education, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>

        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Every student in America deserves a high-quality education in a safe environment. This promise, which was already out of reach for too many, has been further threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. School and higher education administrators, educators, faculty, child care providers, custodians and other staff, and families have gone above and beyond to support children's and students' learning and meet their needs during this crisis. Students and teachers alike have found new ways to teach and learn. Many child care providers continue to provide care and learning opportunities to children in homes and centers across the country. However, leadership and support from the Federal Government is needed. Two principles should guide the Federal Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis with respect to schools, child care providers, Head Start programs, and higher education institutions. First, the health and safety of children, students, educators, families, and communities is paramount. Second, every student in the United States should have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education, during and beyond the pandemic.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration to provide support to help create the conditions for safe, in-person learning as quickly as possible; ensure high-quality instruction and the delivery of essential services often received by students and young children at school, institutions of higher education, child care providers, and Head Start programs; mitigate 
        <PRTPAGE P="458"/>
        learning loss caused by the pandemic; and address educational disparities and inequities that the pandemic has created and exacerbated.

The current economic crisis has affected Americans throughout the Nation, but it is particularly dire in communities of color. The problems are exacerbated because State and local governments are being forced to consider steep cuts to critical programs to address revenue shortfalls the pandemic has caused. In addition, many individuals, families, and small businesses have had difficulties navigating relief programs with varying eligibility requirements, and some are not receiving the intended assistance. The economic crisis resulting from the pandemic must be met by the full resources of the Federal Government.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         All Americans who are qualified to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States (“Armed Forces”) should be able to serve. The All-Volunteer Force thrives when it is composed of diverse Americans who can meet the rigorous standards for military service, and an inclusive military strengthens our national security.
        <PRTPAGE P="467"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is my conviction as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces that gender identity should not be a bar to military service. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military does not have any meaningful negative impact on the Armed Forces. To that end, in 2016, a meticulous, comprehensive study requested by the Department of Defense found that enabling transgender individuals to serve openly in the United States military would have only a minimal impact on military readiness and healthcare costs. The study also concluded that open transgender service has had no significant impact on operational effectiveness or unit cohesion in foreign militaries.</FP>
    <FP>On the basis of this information, the Secretary of Defense concluded in 2016 that permitting transgender individuals to serve openly in the military was consistent with military readiness and with strength through diversity, such that transgender service members who could meet the required standards and procedures should be permitted to serve openly. The Secretary of Defense also concluded that it was appropriate to create a process that would enable service members to take steps to transition gender while serving.</FP>
    <FP>The previous administration chose to alter that policy to bar transgender persons, in almost all circumstances, from joining the Armed Forces and from being able to take steps to transition gender while serving. Rather than relying on the comprehensive study by a nonpartisan federally funded research center, the previous administration relied on a review that resulted in a policy that set unnecessary barriers to military service. It is my judgment that the Secretary of Defense's 2016 conclusions remain valid, as further demonstrated by the fact that, in 2018, the then-serving Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force all testified publicly to the Congress that they were not aware of any issues of unit cohesion, disciplinary problems, or issues of morale resulting from open transgender service. A group of former United States Surgeons General, who collectively served under Democratic and Republican Presidents, echoed this point, stating in 2018 that “transgender troops are as medically fit as their non-transgender peers and that there is no medically valid reason—including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria—to exclude them from military service or to limit their access to medically necessary care.”</FP>
    <FP>Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States to ensure that all transgender individuals who wish to serve in the United States military and can meet the appropriate standards shall be able to do so openly and free from discrimination.</FP>

To decrease incarceration levels, we must reduce profit-based incentives to incarcerate by phasing out the Federal Government's reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities.
    </FP>
    <FP>We must ensure that our Nation's incarceration and correctional systems are prioritizing rehabilitation and redemption. Incarcerated individuals should be given a fair chance to fully reintegrate into their communities, including by participating in programming tailored to earning a good living, securing affordable housing, and participating in our democracy as our fellow citizens. However, privately operated criminal detention facilities consistently underperform Federal facilities with respect to correctional services, programs, and resources. We should ensure that time in prison prepares individuals for the next chapter of their lives.</FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government also has a responsibility to ensure the safe and humane treatment of those in the Federal criminal justice system. However, as the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General found in 2016, privately operated criminal detention facilities do not maintain the same levels of safety and security for people in the Federal criminal justice system or for correctional staff. We have a duty to provide these individuals with safe working and living conditions.</FP>

    <EAR>EO 14008</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad</HD>
    <FP>The United States and the world face a profound climate crisis. We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents. Domestic action must go hand in hand with United States international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action. Together, we must listen to science and meet the moment.</FP>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">PART I—PUTTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AT THE CENTER OF UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY</E>
    </FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 101</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy</E>
        . United States international engagement to address climate change—which has become a climate crisis—is more necessary and urgent than ever. The scientific community has made clear that the scale and speed of necessary action is greater than previously believed. There is little time left to avoid setting the world on a dangerous, potentially catastrophic, climate trajectory. Responding to the climate crisis will require both significant short-term global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and net-zero global emissions by mid-century or before.
        <PRTPAGE P="478"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration that climate considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and national security. The United States will work with other countries and partners, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to put the world on a sustainable climate pathway. The United States will also move quickly to build resilience, both at home and abroad, against the impacts of climate change that are already manifest and will continue to intensify according to current trajectories.</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 102</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose</E>
        . This order builds on and reaffirms actions my Administration has already taken to place the climate crisis at the forefront of this Nation's foreign policy and national security planning, including submitting the United States instrument of acceptance to rejoin the Paris Agreement. In implementing—and building upon—the Paris Agreement's three overarching objectives (a safe global temperature, increased climate resilience, and financial flows aligned with a pathway toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development), the United States will exercise its leadership to promote a significant increase in global climate ambition to meet the climate challenge. In this regard:
    </FP>
    <P>(a) I will host an early Leaders' Climate Summit aimed at raising climate ambition and making a positive contribution to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) and beyond.</P>
    <P>(b) The United States will reconvene the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, beginning with the Leaders' Climate Summit. In cooperation with the members of that Forum, as well as with other partners as appropriate, the United States will pursue green recovery efforts, initiatives to advance the clean energy transition, sectoral decarbonization, and alignment of financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, including with respect to coal financing, nature-based solutions, and solutions to other climate-related challenges.</P>
    <P>(c) I have created a new Presidentially appointed position, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, to elevate the issue of climate change and underscore the commitment my Administration will make toward addressing it.</P>
    <P>(d) Recognizing that climate change affects a wide range of subjects, it will be a United States priority to press for enhanced climate ambition and integration of climate considerations across a wide range of international fora, including the Group of Seven (G7), the Group of Twenty (G20), and fora that address clean energy, aviation, shipping, the Arctic, the ocean, sustainable development, migration, and other relevant topics. The Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and others, as appropriate, are encouraged to promote innovative approaches, including international multi-stakeholder initiatives. In addition, my Administration will work in partnership with States, localities, Tribes, territories, and other United States stakeholders to advance United States climate diplomacy.</P>
    <P>
        (e) The United States will immediately begin the process of developing its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement. The process will include analysis and input from relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), as well as appropriate outreach to domestic stakeholders. The United States will aim to submit its nationally determined contribution in advance of the Leaders' Climate Summit.
        <PRTPAGE P="479"/>
    </P>
    <P>(f) The United States will also immediately begin to develop a climate finance plan, making strategic use of multilateral and bilateral channels and institutions, to assist developing countries in implementing ambitious emissions reduction measures, protecting critical ecosystems, building resilience against the impacts of climate change, and promoting the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, shall lead a process to develop this plan, with the participation of the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Director of the United States Trade and Development Agency, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the head of any other agency providing foreign assistance and development financing, as appropriate. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit the plan to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, within 90 days of the date of this order.</P>
    <P>(g) The Secretary of the Treasury shall:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) ensure that the United States is present and engaged in relevant international fora and institutions that are working on the management of climate-related financial risks;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) develop a strategy for how the voice and vote of the United States can be used in international financial institutions, including the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, to promote financing programs, economic stimulus packages, and debt relief initiatives that are aligned with and support the goals of the Paris Agreement; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) develop, in collaboration with the Secretary of State, the Administrator of USAID, and the Chief Executive Officer of the DFC, a plan for promoting the protection of the Amazon rainforest and other critical ecosystems that serve as global carbon sinks, including through market-based mechanisms.</FP>
    <P>(h) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy shall work together and with the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Chief Executive Officer of the DFC, and the heads of other agencies and partners, as appropriate, to identify steps through which the United States can promote ending international financing of carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based energy while simultaneously advancing sustainable development and a green recovery, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) The Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Secretary of State and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall identify steps through which the United States can intensify international collaborations to drive innovation and deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection.</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">
        (j) The Secretary of State shall prepare, within 60 days of the date of this order, a transmittal package seeking the Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, regarding the phasedown of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons.

        . Even as our Nation emerges from profound public health and economic crises borne of a pandemic, we face a climate crisis that threatens our people and communities, public health and economy, and, starkly, our ability to live on planet Earth. Despite the peril that is already evident, there is promise in the solutions—opportunities to create well-paying union jobs to build a modern and sustainable infrastructure, deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.
    </FP>
    <FP>We must listen to science—and act. We must strengthen our clean air and water protections. We must hold polluters accountable for their actions. We must deliver environmental justice in communities all across America. The Federal Government must drive assessment, disclosure, and mitigation of climate pollution and climate-related risks in every sector of our economy, marshaling the creativity, courage, and capital necessary to make our Nation resilient in the face of this threat. Together, we must combat the climate crisis with bold, progressive action that combines the full capacity of the Federal Government with efforts from every corner of our Nation, every level of government, and every sector of our economy.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to organize and deploy the full capacity of its agencies to combat the climate crisis to implement a Government-wide approach that reduces climate pollution in every sector of the economy; increases resilience to the impacts of climate change; protects public health; conserves our lands, waters, and biodiversity; delivers environmental justice; and spurs well-paying union jobs and economic growth, especially through innovation, commercialization, and deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure.

        . The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a historic public health and economic crisis. In January of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading, the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. In March of 2020, the President declared a national emergency. Although almost a year has passed, the emergency continues—over 5 million Americans have contracted the disease in January 2021, and thousands are dying every week. Over 30 million Americans remain uninsured, preventing many from obtaining necessary health services and treatment. Black, Latino, and Native American persons are more likely to be uninsured, and communities of color have been especially hard hit by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn. In light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider establishing a Special Enrollment Period for uninsured and under-insured Americans to seek coverage through the Federally Facilitated Marketplace, pursuant to existing authorities, including sections 18031 and 18041 of title 42, United States Code, and section 155.420(d)(9) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, and consistent with applicable law.

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         For generations, immigrants have come to the United States with little more than the clothes on their backs, hope in their hearts, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream. These mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters have made our Nation better and stronger.
    </FP>
    <FP>The United States is also a country with borders and with laws that must be enforced. Securing our borders does not require us to ignore the humanity of those who seek to cross them. The opposite is true. We cannot solve the humanitarian crisis at our border without addressing the violence, instability, and lack of opportunity that compel so many people to flee their homes. Nor is the United States safer when resources that should be invested in policies targeting actual threats, such as drug cartels and human traffickers, are squandered on efforts to stymie legitimate asylum seekers.</FP>
    <FP>Consistent with these principles, my Administration will implement a multi-pronged approach toward managing migration throughout North and Central America that reflects the Nation's highest values. We will work closely with civil society, international organizations, and the governments in the region to: establish a comprehensive strategy for addressing the causes of migration in the region; build, strengthen, and expand Central and North American countries' asylum systems and resettlement capacity; and increase opportunities for vulnerable populations to apply for protection closer to home. At the same time, the United States will enhance lawful pathways for migration to this country and will restore and strengthen our own asylum system, which has been badly damaged by policies enacted over the last 4 years that contravened our values and caused needless human suffering.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>

        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy</E>
        . Over 40 million foreign-born individuals live in the United States today. Millions more Americans have immigrants in their families or ancestry. New Americans and their children fuel our economy, working in every industry, including healthcare, construction, caregiving, manufacturing, service, and agriculture. They open and successfully run businesses at high rates, creating jobs for millions, and they contribute to our arts, culture, and government, providing new traditions, customs, and viewpoints. They are essential workers helping to keep our economy afloat and providing important services to Americans during a global pandemic. They have helped the United States lead the world in science, technology, and innovation. And they are on the frontlines of research to develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and treatments for those afflicted with the deadly disease.
    </FP>
    <FP>Consistent with our character as a Nation of opportunity and of welcome, it is essential to ensure that our laws and policies encourage full participation by immigrants, including refugees, in our civic life; that immigration processes and other benefits are delivered effectively and efficiently; and that the Federal Government eliminates sources of fear and other barriers that prevent immigrants from accessing government services available to them. Our Nation is enriched socially and economically by the presence of immigrants, and we celebrate with them as they take the important step of becoming United States citizens. The Federal Government should develop welcoming strategies that promote integration, inclusion, and citizenship, and it should embrace the full participation of the newest Americans in our democracy.</FP>

        . The role of the White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC) is to convene executive departments and agencies (agencies) to coordinate the formulation and implementation of my Administration's domestic policy objectives. Consistent with that role, the DPC shall coordinate the Federal Government's efforts to welcome and support immigrants, including refugees, and to catalyze State and local integration and inclusion efforts. In furtherance of these goals, the DPC shall convene a Task Force on New Americans, which shall include members of agencies that implement policies that impact immigrant communities.

        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         The long tradition of the United States as a leader in refugee resettlement provides a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, promotes stability in regions experiencing conflict, and facilitates international collaboration to address the global refugee crisis. Through the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the Federal Government, cooperating with private partners and American citizens in communities across the country, demonstrates the generosity and core values of our Nation, while benefitting from the many contributions that refugees make to our country. Accordingly, it shall be the policy of my Administration that:
    </FP>
    <P>
        (a) USRAP and other humanitarian programs shall be administered in a manner that furthers our values as a Nation and is consistent with our domestic law, international obligations, and the humanitarian purposes expressed by the Congress in enacting the Refugee Act of 1980, Public Law 96-212.
        <PRTPAGE P="508"/>
    </P>
    <P>(b) USRAP should be rebuilt and expanded, commensurate with global need and the purposes described above.</P>
    <P>(c) Delays in administering USRAP and other humanitarian programs are counter to our national interests, can raise grave humanitarian concerns, and should be minimized.</P>
    <P>(d) Security vetting for USRAP applicants and applicants for other humanitarian programs should be improved to be more efficient, meaningful, and fair, and should be complemented by sound methods of fraud detection to ensure program integrity and protect national security.</P>
    <P>(e) Although access to United States humanitarian programs is generally discretionary, the individuals applying for immigration benefits under these programs must be treated with dignity and respect, without improper discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or other grounds, and should be afforded procedural safeguards.</P>
    <P>(f) United States humanitarian programs should be administered in a manner that ensures transparency and accountability and reflects the principle that reunifying families is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>(g) My Administration shall seek opportunities to enhance access to the refugee program for people who are more vulnerable to persecution, including women, children, and other individuals who are at risk of persecution related to their gender, gender expression, or sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>(h) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) should explore the use of all available authorities for humanitarian protection to assist individuals for whom USRAP is unavailable.</P>
    <P>(i) To meet the challenges of restoring and expanding USRAP, the United States must innovate, including by effectively employing technology and capitalizing on community and private sponsorship of refugees, while continuing to partner with resettlement agencies for reception and placement.</P>
    <P>(j) The Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programs for Iraqi and Afghan allies provide humanitarian protection to nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan experiencing an ongoing, serious threat because they provided faithful and valuable service to the United States, including its troops serving in those countries. The Federal Government should ensure that these important programs are administered without undue delay.</P>

    <FP>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that the situation in and in relation to Burma, and in particular the February 1, 2021, coup, in which the military overthrew the democratically elected civilian government of Burma and unjustly arrested and detained government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, thereby rejecting the will of the people of Burma as expressed in elections held in November 2020 and undermining the country's democratic transition and rule of law, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby order:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:

        <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>
        . For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.

         Faith-based and other community-serving organizations are vital to our Nation's ability to address the needs of, and lift up, low-income and other underserved persons and communities, notably including persons of color. The American people are key drivers of fundamental change in our country, and few institutions are closer to the people than our faith-based and other community organizations. It is important that the Federal Government strengthen the ability of such organizations and other nonprofit providers in our communities to deliver services effectively in partnership with Federal, State, and local governments and with other private organizations, while preserving our fundamental constitutional commitments guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws and the free exercise of religion and forbidding the establishment of religion. The Federal Government can preserve these fundamental commitments while empowering faith-based and secular organizations to assist in the delivery of vital

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         The United States needs resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains to ensure our economic prosperity and national security. Pandemics and other biological threats, cyber-attacks, climate shocks and extreme weather events, terrorist attacks, geopolitical and economic competition, and other conditions can reduce critical manufacturing capacity and the availability and integrity of critical goods, products, and services. Resilient American supply chains will revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity, maintain America's competitive edge in research and development, and create well-paying jobs. They will also support small businesses, promote prosperity, advance the fight against climate change, and encourage economic growth in communities of color and economically distressed areas.
    </FP>
    <FP>More resilient supply chains are secure and diverse—facilitating greater domestic production, a range of supply, built-in redundancies, adequate stockpiles, safe and secure digital networks, and a world-class American manufacturing base and workforce. Moreover, close cooperation on resilient supply chains with allies and partners who share our values will foster collective economic and national security and strengthen the capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies.</FP>
    <FP>Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to strengthen the resilience of America's supply chains.</FP>

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy. Free and fair elections that reflect the will of the American people must be protected and defended. But many Americans, especially people of color, confront significant obstacles to exercising that fundamental right. These obstacles include difficulties with voter registration, lack of election information, and barriers to access at polling places. For generations, Black voters and other voters of color have faced discriminatory policies and other obstacles that disproportionally affect their communities. These voters remain more likely to face long lines at the polls and are disproportionately burdened by voter identification laws and limited opportunities to vote by mail. Limited access to language assistance remains a barrier for many voters. People with disabilities continue to face barriers to voting and are denied legally required accommodations in exercising their fundamental rights and the ability to vote privately and independently. Members of our military serving overseas, as well as other American citizens living abroad, also face challenges to exercising their fundamental right to vote.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Constitution and laws of the United States prohibit racial discrimination and protect the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other Federal statutes implement those protections and assign the Federal Government a key role in remedying disenfranchisement and unequal access to the polls. In passing the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the Congress found that it is the duty of Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of the fundamental right to vote. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information. It is our duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         It is the policy of my Administration to promote and defend the right to vote for all Americans who are legally entitled to participate in elections. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to expand access to, and education about, voter registration and election information, and to combat misinformation, in order to enable all eligible Americans to participate in our democracy.

         It is the policy of my Administration that all students should be guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex, including discrimination in the form of sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, and including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. For students attending schools and other educational institutions that receive Federal financial assistance, this guarantee is codified, in part, in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 
        <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
         which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.

    <P>(b) The Secretary of Education shall consider taking additional enforcement actions, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to enforce the policy set forth in section 1 of this order as well as legal prohibitions on sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence, to the fullest extent permissible under law; to account for intersecting forms of prohibited discrimination that can affect the availability of resources and support for students who have experienced sex discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race, disability, and national origin; to account for the significant rates at which students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) are subject to sexual harassment, which encompasses sexual violence; to ensure that educational institutions are providing appropriate support for students who have experienced sex discrimination; and to ensure that their school procedures are fair and equitable for all.</P>

    <FP>I, JOSEPH R.

    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13928 of June 11, 2020 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated With the International Criminal Court), and revoke that order, and further order:</FP>

        . For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.

In the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. 7101(a)(1)), the Congress found that “experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them . . . safeguards the public interest, . . . contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and . . . facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment.”
    </FP>
    <FP>In the past few decades, the Federal Government has not used its full authority to promote and implement this policy of support for workers organizing unions and bargaining collectively with their employers. During this period, economic change in the United States and globally, technological developments, and the failure to modernize Federal organizing and labor-management relations laws to respond appropriately to the reality found in American workplaces, have made worker organizing exceedingly difficult.</FP>
    <FP>The result has been a steady decline in union density in the United States and the loss of worker power and voice in workplaces and communities across the country. This decline has had a host of negative consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening and shrinking America's middle class. Meanwhile, some workers have been excluded from opportunities to organize unions and bargain collectively with their employers by law or practice, and so have never been able to build meaningful economic power or have a voice in their workplaces.</FP>
    <FP>Confirming the policies declared in Federal labor laws, substantial evidence shows that union membership increases wages, the likelihood of receiving employer-provided benefits, and job security. Union membership also gives workers the means to build the power to ensure that their voices are heard in their workplaces, their communities, and in the Nation.</FP>
    <FP>
        Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to encourage worker organizing and collective bargaining.

         This order promotes economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by increasing the hourly minimum wage paid by the parties that contract with the Federal Government to $15.00 for those workers working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract as described in section 8 of this order. Raising the minimum wage enhances worker productivity and generates higher-quality work by boosting workers' health, morale, and effort; reducing absenteeism and turnover; and lowering supervisory and training costs. Accordingly, ensuring that Federal contractors pay their workers an hourly wage of at least $15.00 will bolster economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.

This clause shall specify that, as a condition of payment, the minimum wage to be paid to workers employed in the performance of the contract or any covered subcontract thereunder, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 214(c)), shall be at least:

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private sector, and ultimately the American people's security and privacy. The Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors. The Federal Government must also carefully examine what occurred during any major cyber incident and apply lessons learned. But cybersecurity requires more than government action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector. The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace. In the end, the trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.
    </FP>
    <FP>Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the American way of life. The Federal Government must bring to bear the full scope of its authorities and resources to protect and secure its computer systems, whether they are cloud-based, on-premises, or hybrid. The scope of protection and security must include systems that process data (information technology (IT)) and those that run the vital machinery that ensures our safety (operational technology (OT)).</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration that the prevention, detection, assessment, and remediation of cyber incidents is a top priority and essential to national and economic security. The Federal Government must lead by example. All Federal Information Systems should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant to this order.</FP>

        <E T="03">Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information.</E>
         (a) The Federal Government contracts with IT and OT service providers to conduct an array of day-to-day functions on Federal Information Systems. These service providers, including cloud service providers, have unique access to and insight into cyber threat and incident information on Federal Information Systems. At the same time, current contract terms or restrictions may limit the sharing of such threat or incident information with executive departments and agencies (agencies) that are responsible for investigating or remediating cyber incidents, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other elements of the Intelligence Community (IC). Removing these contractual barriers and increasing the sharing of information about such threats, incidents, and risks are necessary steps to accelerating incident deterrence, prevention, and response efforts and to enabling more effective defense of

        <E T="03">Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security.</E>
         (a) The security of software used by the Federal Government is vital to the Federal Government's ability to perform its critical functions. The development of commercial software often lacks transparency, sufficient focus on the ability of the software to resist attack, and adequate controls to prevent tampering by malicious actors. There is a pressing need to implement more rigorous and predictable mechanisms for ensuring that products function securely, and as intended. The security and integrity of “critical software”—software that performs functions critical to trust (such as affording or requiring elevated system privileges or direct access to networking and computing resources)—is a particular concern. Accordingly, the Federal Government must take action to rapidly improve the security and integrity of the software supply chain, with a priority on addressing critical software.

    <P>
        (a) the term “agency” has the meaning ascribed to it under 44 U.S.C. 3502.
        <PRTPAGE P="571"/>
    </P>
    <P>(b) the term “auditing trust relationship” means an agreed-upon relationship between two or more system elements that is governed by criteria for secure interaction, behavior, and outcomes relative to the protection of assets.</P>
    <P>(c) the term “cyber incident” has the meaning ascribed to an “incident” under 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(2).</P>
    <P>(d) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies” or “FCEB Agencies” includes all agencies except for the Department of Defense and agencies in the Intelligence Community.</P>
    <P>(e) the term “Federal Civilian Executive Branch Information Systems” or “FCEB Information Systems” means those information systems operated by Federal Civilian Executive Branch Agencies, but excludes National Security Systems.</P>
    <P>(f) the term “Federal Information Systems” means an information system used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or by another organization on behalf of an agency, including FCEB Information Systems and National Security Systems.</P>
    <P>(g) the term “Intelligence Community” or “IC” has the meaning ascribed to it under 50 U.S.C. 3003(4).</P>
    <P>(h) the term “National Security Systems” means information systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6), 3553(e)(2), and 3553(e)(3).</P>
    <P>(i) the term “logs” means records of the events occurring within an organization's systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries, and each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within a system or network.</P>
    <P>(j) the term “Software Bill of Materials” or “SBOM” means a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software. Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open source and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these components in a product. It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging. An SBOM is useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software, and those who operate software. Developers often use available open source and third-party software components to create a product; an SBOM allows the builder to make sure those components are up to date and to respond quickly to new vulnerabilities. Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product. Those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly and easily determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability. A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration. The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM, and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.</P>
    <P>
        (k) the term “Zero Trust Architecture” means a security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries. The Zero Trust security 
        <PRTPAGE P="572"/>
        model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. In essence, a Zero Trust Architecture allows users full access but only to the bare minimum they need to perform their jobs. If a device is compromised, zero trust can ensure that the damage is contained. The Zero Trust Architecture security model assumes that a breach is inevitable or has likely already occurred, so it constantly limits access to only what is needed and looks for anomalous or malicious activity. Zero Trust Architecture embeds comprehensive security monitoring; granular risk-based access controls; and system security automation in a coordinated manner throughout all aspects of the infrastructure in order to focus on protecting data in real-time within a dynamic threat environment. This data-centric security model allows the concept of least-privileged access to be applied for every access decision, where the answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how are critical for appropriately allowing or denying access to resources based on the combination of sever.

        . The intensifying impacts of climate change present physical risk to assets, publicly traded securities, private investments, and companies—such as increased extreme weather risk leading to supply chain disruptions. In addition, the global shift away from carbon-intensive energy sources and industrial processes presents transition risk to many companies, communities, and workers. At the same time, this global shift presents generational opportunities to enhance U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, while also creating well-paying job opportunities for workers. The failure of financial institutions to appropriately and adequately account for and measure these physical and transition risks threatens the competitiveness of U.S. companies and markets, the life savings and pensions of U.S. workers and families, and the ability of U.S. financial institutions to serve communities. In this effort, the Federal Government should lead by example by appropriately prioritizing Federal investments and conducting prudent fiscal management.
    </FP>
    <FP>It is therefore the policy of my Administration to advance consistent, clear, intelligible, comparable, and accurate disclosure of climate-related financial risk (consistent with Executive Order 13707 of September 15, 2015 (Using Behavioral Science Insights to Better Serve the American People)), including both physical and transition risks; act to mitigate that risk and its drivers, while accounting for and addressing disparate impacts on disadvantaged communities and communities of color (consistent with Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government)) and spurring the creation of well-paying jobs; and achieve our target of a net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. This policy will marshal the creativity, courage, and capital of the United States necessary to bolster the resilience of our rural and urban communities, States, Tribes, territories, and financial institutions in the face of the climate crisis, rather than exacerbate its causes, and position the United States to lead the global economy to a more prosperous and sustainable future.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Advancing Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
         
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) individuals and communities are irrefutable sources of our Nation's strength. These communities have molded the American experience, and the achievements of AA and NHPI communities make the United States stronger and more vibrant. The richness of America's multicultural democracy is strengthened by the diversity of AA and NHPI communities and the many cultures and languages of AA and NHPI individuals in the United States.
    </FP>
    <FP>Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities together constitute the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and make rich contributions to our society, our economy, and our culture. Yet for far too long, systemic barriers to equity, justice, and opportunity put the American dream out of reach of many AA and NHPI communities. Many AA and NHPI individuals face persistent disparities in socioeconomic, health, and educational outcomes. Linguistic isolation and lack of access to language-assistance services continue to lock many AA and NHPI individuals out of opportunity. Too often Federal data collection practices fail to measure, reflect, and disaggregate the diversity of AA and NHPI experiences. These practices contribute to often painful and enduring stereotypes about Asian Americans as a “model minority” and obscure disparities within AA and NHPI communities.</FP>
    <FP>
        Our Nation has also seen again that anti-Asian bias, xenophobia, racism, and nativism have deep roots in our Nation. Tragic acts of anti-Asian violence have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, casting a shadow of fear and grief over many AA and NHPI communities, in particular East Asian communities. Long before this pandemic, AA and NHPI communities in the United States—including South Asian and Southeast Asian communities—have faced persistent xenophobia, religious discrimination, racism, and violence. The Federal Government must provide the moral 
        <PRTPAGE P="580"/>
        leadership, policies, and programs to address and end anti-Asian violence and discrimination, and advance inclusion and belonging for all AA and NHPI communities.
    </FP>
    <FP>At the same time, many AA and NHPI communities, and in particular Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities, have also been disproportionately burdened by the COVID-19 public health crisis. Evidence suggests that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are three times more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to white people and nearly twice as likely to die from the disease. On top of these health inequities, many AA and NHPI families and small businesses have faced devastating economic losses during this crisis, which must be addressed.</FP>
    <FP>As I directed in Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), the entire Federal Government must advance equity and racial justice for underserved communities, which include AA and NHPI communities. As I established in the Presidential Memorandum of January 26, 2021 (Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States), it is the policy of my Administration to address and confront racism, xenophobia, and intolerance. The purpose of this order is to build on those policies by establishing the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. Both will work to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities in the United States.</FP>

    </FP>
    <FP>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that additional steps are necessary to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020 (Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies), including the threat posed by the military-industrial complex of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and its involvement in military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, and weapons and related equipment production under the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion strategy. In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats, which have their source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and I hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 to address those threats.</FP>

        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
    </FP>
    <FP>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that it is appropriate to elaborate upon measures to address the national emergency with respect to the information and communications technology and services supply chain that was declared in Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain). Specifically, the increased use in the United States of certain connected software applications designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of, a foreign adversary, which the Secretary of Commerce acting pursuant to Executive Order 13873 has defined to include the People's Republic of China, among others, continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The Federal Government should evaluate these threats through rigorous, evidence-based analysis and should address any unacceptable or undue risks consistent with overall national security, foreign policy, and economic objectives, including the preservation and demonstration of America's core values and fundamental freedoms.</FP>
    <FP>
        By operating on United States information and communications technology devices, including personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including United States persons' 
        <PRTPAGE P="595"/>
        personal information and proprietary business information. This data collection threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information. Foreign adversary access to large repositories of United States persons' data also presents a significant risk.
    </FP>
    <FP>In evaluating the risks of a connected software application, several factors should be considered. Consistent with the criteria established in Executive Order 13873, and in addition to the criteria set forth in implementing regulations, potential indicators of risk relating to connected software applications include: ownership, control, or management by persons that support a foreign adversary's military, intelligence, or proliferation activities; use of the connected software application to conduct surveillance that enables espionage, including through a foreign adversary's access to sensitive or confidential government or business information, or sensitive personal data; ownership, control, or management of connected software applications by persons subject to coercion or cooption by a foreign adversary; ownership, control, or management of connected software applications by persons involved in malicious cyber activities; a lack of thorough and reliable third-party auditing of connected software applications; the scope and sensitivity of the data collected; the number and sensitivity of the users of the connected software application; and the extent to which identified risks have been or can be addressed by independently verifiable measures.</FP>
    <FP>The ongoing emergency declared in Executive Order 13873 arises from a variety of factors, including the continuing effort of foreign adversaries to steal or otherwise obtain United States persons' data. That continuing effort by foreign adversaries constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. To address this threat, the United States must act to protect against the risks associated with connected software applications that are designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of, a foreign adversary.</FP>
    <FP>Additionally, the United States seeks to promote accountability for persons who engage in serious human rights abuse. If persons who own, control, or manage connected software applications engage in serious human rights abuse or otherwise facilitate such abuse, the United States may impose consequences on those persons in action separate from this order.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that:</FP>

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104, 3301, and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to strengthen the Federal workforce by promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         On my first day in office, I signed Executive Order 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), which established that affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government. To further advance equity within the Federal Government, this order establishes that it is the policy of my Administration to cultivate a workforce that draws from the full diversity of the Nation.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government must be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees are 
        <PRTPAGE P="598"/>
        treated with dignity and respect. Accordingly, the Federal Government must strengthen its ability to recruit, hire, develop, promote, and retain our Nation's talent and remove barriers to equal opportunity. It must also provide resources and opportunities to strengthen and advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across the Federal Government. The Federal Government should have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the American people. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible workplaces yield higher-performing organizations.
    </FP>
    <FP>Federal merit system principles include that the Federal Government's recruitment policies should “endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of society” and that “[a]ll employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management” (5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), (2)). As set forth in Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-Wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce), the Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce), Executive Order 13988 of January 20, 2021 (Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation), the National Security Memorandum of February 4, 2021 (Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships), and Executive Order 14020 of March 8, 2021 (Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council), the Federal Government is at its best when drawing upon all parts of society, our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges, and all persons should receive equal treatment under the law. This order reaffirms support for, and builds upon, the procedures established by Executive Orders 13583, 13988, and 14020, the Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce, and the National Security Memorandum on Revitalizing America's Foreign Policy and National Security Workforce, Institutions, and Partnerships. This order establishes that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility are priorities for my Administration and benefit the entire Federal Government and the Nation, and establishes additional procedures to advance these priorities across the Federal workforce.</FP>

         For purposes of this order, in the context of the Federal workforce:
    </FP>
    <P>
        (a) The term “underserved communities” refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, who have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life. In the context of the Federal workforce, this term includes individuals who belong to communities of color, such as Black and African American, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, Alaska Native and Indigenous, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, and North African persons. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (LGBTQ+) 
        <PRTPAGE P="599"/>
        persons); persons who face discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions; parents; and caregivers. It also includes individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination based on their religion or disability; first-generation professionals or first-generation college students; individuals with limited English proficiency; immigrants; individuals who belong to communities that may face employment barriers based on older age or former incarceration; persons who live in rural areas; veterans and military spouses; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty, discrimination, or inequality. Individuals may belong to more than one underserved community and face intersecting barriers.
    </P>
    <P>(b) The term “diversity” means the practice of including the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures, and beliefs of the American people, including underserved communities.</P>
    <P>(c) The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment.</P>
    <P>(d) The term “inclusion” means the recognition, appreciation, and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds.</P>
    <P>(e) The term “accessibility” means the design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. Accessibility includes the provision of accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to employment and participation in activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimination of physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a commitment to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every outward-facing and internal activity or electronic space, and the pursuit of best practices such as universal design.</P>
    <P>(f) The term “agency” means any authority of the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than one considered to be an independent regulatory agency, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).</P>

    </P>
    <P>(e) support, coordinate, and encourage agency efforts to conduct research, evaluation, and other evidence-building activities to identify leading practices, and other promising practices, for broadening participation and opportunities for advancement in Federal employment, and to assess and promote the benefits of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for Federal performance and operations and barriers to achieving these goals. Agencies should use the capabilities of their evaluation officers and chief statistical officers and requirements under the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, Public Law 115-435, to advance this goal.</P>

    <EXECORDR>Executive Order 14036 of July 9, 2021</EXECORDR>
    <EAR>14036</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Promoting Competition in the American Economy</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         A fair, open, and competitive marketplace has long been a cornerstone of the American economy, while excessive market concentration threatens basic economic liberties, democratic accountability, and the welfare of workers, farmers, small businesses, startups, and consumers.
    </FP>
    <FP>The American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on an open and competitive economy. For workers, a competitive marketplace creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs or negotiate a higher wage. For small businesses and farmers, it creates more choices among suppliers and major buyers, leading to more take-home income, which they can reinvest in their enterprises. For entrepreneurs, it provides space to experiment, innovate, and pursue the new ideas that have for centuries powered the American economy and improved our quality of life. And for consumers, it means more choices, better service, and lower prices.</FP>
    <FP>Robust competition is critical to preserving America's role as the world's leading economy.</FP>
    <FP>Yet over the last several decades, as industries have consolidated, competition has weakened in too many markets, denying Americans the benefits of an open economy and widening racial, income, and wealth inequality. Federal Government inaction has contributed to these problems, with workers, farmers, small businesses, and consumers paying the price.</FP>
    <FP>
        Consolidation has increased the power of corporate employers, making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work conditions. Powerful companies require workers to sign non-compete agreements that restrict their ability to change jobs. And, while many occupational licenses 
        <PRTPAGE P="610"/>
        are critical to increasing wages for workers and especially workers of color, some overly restrictive occupational licensing requirements can impede workers' ability to find jobs and to move between States.
    </FP>
    <FP>Consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it too hard for small family farms to survive. Farmers are squeezed between concentrated market power in the agricultural input industries—seed, fertilizer, feed, and equipment suppliers—and concentrated market power in the channels for selling agricultural products. As a result, farmers' share of the value of their agricultural products has decreased, and poultry farmers, hog farmers, cattle ranchers, and other agricultural workers struggle to retain autonomy and to make sustainable returns.</FP>
    <FP>The American information technology sector has long been an engine of innovation and growth, but today a small number of dominant internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage. Too many small businesses across the economy depend on those platforms and a few online marketplaces for their survival. And too many local newspapers have shuttered or downsized, in part due to the internet platforms' dominance in advertising markets.</FP>
    <FP>Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare services—far more than the prices paid in other countries. Hospital consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive healthcare options. And too often, patent and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay—for years and even decades—competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying Americans access to lower-cost drugs.</FP>
    <FP>In the telecommunications sector, Americans likewise pay too much for broadband, cable television, and other communications services, in part because of a lack of adequate competition. In the financial-services sector, consumers pay steep and often hidden fees because of industry consolidation. Similarly, the global container shipping industry has consolidated into a small number of dominant foreign-owned lines and alliances, which can disadvantage American exporters.</FP>
    <FP>The problem of economic consolidation now spans these sectors and many others, endangering our ability to rebuild and emerge from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with a vibrant, innovative, and growing economy. Meanwhile, the United States faces new challenges to its economic standing in the world, including unfair competitive pressures from foreign monopolies and firms that are state-owned or state-sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by foreign governments.</FP>
    <FP>We must act now to reverse these dangerous trends, which constrain the growth and dynamism of our economy, impair the creation of high-quality jobs, and threaten America's economic standing in the world.</FP>
    <FP>
        This order affirms that it is the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony—especially as these issues arise in labor markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets), repair markets, and United States markets directly affected by foreign cartel activity.
        <PRTPAGE P="611"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is also the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies, including the rise of the dominant Internet platforms, especially as they stem from serial mergers, the acquisition of nascent competitors, the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets, the surveillance of users, and the presence of network effects.</FP>
    <FP>
        Whereas decades of industry consolidation have often led to excessive market concentration, this order reaffirms that the United States retains the authority to challenge transactions whose previous consummation was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (Sherman Act), the Clayton Antitrust Act (Public Law 63-212, 38 Stat. 730, 15 U.S.C. 12 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (Clayton Act), or other laws. 
        <E T="03">See</E>
         15 U.S.C. 18; 
        <E T="03">Standard Oil Co. v. United States,</E>
         221 U.S. 1 (1911).
    </FP>
    <FP>This order reasserts as United States policy that the answer to the rising power of foreign monopolies and cartels is not the tolerance of domestic monopolization, but rather the promotion of competition and innovation by firms small and large, at home and worldwide.</FP>
    <FP>It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms. It is further the policy of my Administration to support the enactment of a public health insurance option.</FP>
    <FP>
        My Administration further reaffirms the policy stated in Executive Order 13725 of April 15, 2016 (Steps to Increase Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth of the American Economy), and the Federal Government's commitment to the principles that led to the passage of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (Public Law 67-51, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C. 181 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (Packers and Stockyards Act), the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act (Public Law 81-899, 64 Stat. 1125), the Bank Merger Act (Public Law 86-463, 74 Stat. 129, 12 U.S.C. 1828), and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104, 110 Stat. 56), among others.

    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">The Statutory Basis of a Whole-of-Government Competition Policy.</E>
         (a) The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act (Public Law 63-203, 38 Stat. 717, 15 U.S.C. 41 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), are a first line of defense against the monopolization of the American economy.
    </FP>
    <P>
        (b) The antitrust laws reflect an underlying policy favoring competition that transcends those particular enactments. As the Supreme Court has stated, for instance, the Sherman Act “rests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.” 
        <E T="03">Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States,</E>
         356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958).
    </P>
    <P>
        (c) Consistent with these broader policies, and in addition to the traditional antitrust laws, the Congress has also enacted industry-specific fair competition and anti-monopolization laws that often provide additional protections. Such enactments include the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (Public Law 74-401, 49 Stat. 977, 27 
        <PRTPAGE P="612"/>
        U.S.C. 201 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), the Bank Merger Act, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585), the Shipping Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-237, 98 Stat. 67, 46 U.S.C. 40101 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (Shipping Act), the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-88, 109 Stat. 803), the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (Public Law 108-164, 117 Stat. 2024, 15 U.S.C. 7601 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376) (Dodd-Frank Act).
    </P>
    <P>(d) These statutes independently charge a number of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to protect conditions of fair competition in one or more ways, including by:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) policing unfair, deceptive, and abusive business practices;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) resisting consolidation and promoting competition within industries through the independent oversight of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) promulgating rules that promote competition, including the market entry of new competitors; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) promoting market transparency through compelled disclosure of information.</FP>
    <P>(e) The agencies that administer such or similar authorities include the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Maritime Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Surface Transportation Board.</P>
    <P>
        (f) Agencies can influence the conditions of competition through their exercise of regulatory authority or through the procurement process. 
        <E T="03">See</E>
         41 U.S.C. 1705.
    </P>
    <P>(g) This order recognizes that a whole-of-government approach is necessary to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in the American economy. Such an approach is supported by existing statutory mandates. Agencies can and should further the polices set forth in section 1 of this order by, among other things, adopting pro-competitive regulations and approaches to procurement and spending, and by rescinding regulations that create unnecessary barriers to entry that stifle competition.</P>

        . 
        <E T="03">Agency Cooperation in Oversight, Investigation, and Remedies.</E>
         (a) The Congress frequently has created overlapping agency jurisdiction in the policing of anticompetitive conduct and the oversight of mergers. It is the policy of my Administration that, when agencies have overlapping jurisdiction, they should endeavor to cooperate fully in the exercise of their oversight authority, to benefit from the respective expertise of the agencies and to improve Government efficiency.

        (b) Where there is overlapping jurisdiction over particular cases, conduct, transactions, or industries, agencies are encouraged to coordinate their efforts, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, with respect to:

    <P>(d) Nothing in subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall be construed to suggest that the statutory standard applied by an agency, or its independent assessment under that standard, should be displaced or substituted by the judgment of the Attorney General or the Chair of the FTC.

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         America must lead the world on clean and efficient cars and trucks. That means bolstering our domestic market by setting a goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles. My Administration will prioritize setting clear standards, expanding key infrastructure, spurring critical innovation, and investing in the American autoworker. This will allow us to boost jobs—with good pay and benefits—across the United States along the full supply chain for the automotive sector, from parts and equipment manufacturing to final assembly.
    </FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to advance these objectives in order to improve our economy and public health, boost energy security, secure consumer savings, advance environmental justice, and address the climate crisis.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Declassification Reviews of Certain Documents Concerning the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001</HD>

        <E T="03">Policy</E>
        . Many Americans continue to seek full accountability for the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), including 9/11 survivors and victims' family members. As the 20th anniversary of 9/11 approaches, the American people deserve to have a fuller picture of what their Government knows about those attacks. Although the indiscriminate release of classified information could jeopardize the national security—including the United States Government's efforts to protect against future acts of terrorism—information should not remain classified when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. The significant events in question occurred two decades ago or longer, and they concern a tragic moment that continues to resonate in American history and in the lives of so many Americans. It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, relying on classification only when narrowly tailored and necessary. Thus, information collected and generated in the United States Government's investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks should now be disclosed, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise.

    <FP>
        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance equity in economic and educational opportunities for all Americans, including Black 
        <PRTPAGE P="635"/>
        Americans, strengthen the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to provide the highest-quality education, increase opportunities for these institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs, and ensure that HBCUs can continue to be engines of opportunity, it is hereby ordered as follows:
    </FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy</E>
        . HBCUs have a proud history and legacy of achievement. In the face of discrimination against Black Americans by many institutions of higher education, HBCUs created pathways to opportunity and educational excellence for Black students throughout our Nation. That legacy continues. Today, more than 100 HBCUs, located in 19 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, serve nearly 300,000 students annually. HBCUs vary in size and academic focus and serve a range of diverse students and communities in urban, rural, and suburban settings.
    </FP>
    <FP>HBCUs play a vital role in providing educational opportunities, scholarly growth, and a sense of community for students. HBCU graduates are barrier-breaking public servants, scientists, artists, lawyers, engineers, educators, business owners, and leaders. For generations, HBCUs have been advancing intergenerational economic mobility for Black families and communities, developing vital academic research, and making our country more prosperous and equitable. HBCUs are proven means of advancement for people of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially Black Americans. HBCUs produce nearly 20 percent of all Black college graduates and 25 percent of Black graduates who earn degrees in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math.</FP>
    <FP>HBCUs' successes have come despite many systemic barriers to accessing resources and opportunities. For example, compared to other higher education institutions, on average HBCUs educate a greater percentage of lower-income, Pell-grant eligible students, while receiving less revenue from tuition and possessing much smaller endowments. Disparities in resources and opportunities for HBCUs and their students remain, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted continuing and new challenges. These challenges include addressing the need for enhanced physical and digital infrastructure in HBCU communities and ensuring equitable funding for HBCUs as compared to other institutions of higher education. The Federal Government must promote a variety of modern solutions for HBCUs, recognizing that HBCUs are not a monolith, and that the opportunities and challenges relevant to HBCUs are as diverse as the institutions themselves and the communities they serve.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity in partnership with HBCUs, and to ensure that these vital institutions of higher learning have the resources and support to continue to thrive for generations to come.</FP>

    <EAR>EO 14043</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301, 3302, and 7301 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         It is the policy of my Administration to halt the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, by relying on the best available data and science-based public health measures. The Delta variant, currently the predominant variant of the virus in the United States, is highly contagious and has led to a rapid rise in cases and hospitalizations. The nationwide public health emergency, first declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on January 31, 2020, remains in effect, as does the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) declared pursuant to the National Emergencies Act in Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the Department of Health and Human Services has determined that the best 
        <PRTPAGE P="644"/>
        way to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to prevent infection by the Delta variant or other variants is to be vaccinated.
    </FP>
    <FP>COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the United States. They protect people from getting infected and severely ill, and they significantly reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and death. As of the date of this order, one of the COVID-19 vaccines, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, also known as Comirnaty, has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and two others, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, have been authorized by the FDA for emergency use. The FDA has determined that all three vaccines meet its rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality.</FP>
    <FP>The health and safety of the Federal workforce, and the health and safety of members of the public with whom they interact, are foundational to the efficiency of the civil service. I have determined that ensuring the health and safety of the Federal workforce and the efficiency of the civil service requires immediate action to protect the Federal workforce and individuals interacting with the Federal workforce. It is essential that Federal employees take all available steps to protect themselves and avoid spreading COVID-19 to their co-workers and members of the public. The CDC has found that the best way to do so is to be vaccinated.</FP>
    <FP>The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (Task Force), established by Executive Order 13991 of January 20, 2021 (Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask-Wearing), has issued important guidance to protect the Federal workforce and individuals interacting with the Federal workforce. Agencies have also taken important actions, including in some cases requiring COVID-19 vaccination for members of their workforce.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, building on these actions, and in light of the public health guidance regarding the most effective and necessary defenses against COVID-19, I have determined that to promote the health and safety of the Federal workforce and the efficiency of the civil service, it is necessary to require COVID-19 vaccination for all Federal employees, subject to such exceptions as required by law.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Nearly 14 million students in our Nation's public elementary and secondary school system and nearly 4 million students in post-secondary education are Hispanic. Hispanic students constitute more than 27 percent of all pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students and nearly 20 percent of college students. The Nation's future prosperity and global leadership across industries is therefore tied to the success of Hispanic and Latino students, and their success is a priority of my Administration.
    </FP>
    <FP>From advancements in science and civil and labor rights to leadership in government, advocacy, entrepreneurship, and business, the Hispanic community has had a profound and positive impact on our schools, our communities, our economy, and our Nation. Hispanic and Latino communities encompass many racial and cultural identities that span the globe. The diversity of Hispanic and Latino students makes our classrooms across the country rich learning environments. It is important to ensure that from early childhood to higher education, Hispanic and Latino students, including Dreamers, can reach their highest potential. For many Hispanic and Latino students, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) provide critical pathways to opportunity, and hundreds of HSIs across our Nation are advancing intergenerational mobility, success, and opportunity.</FP>
    <FP>At the same time, Hispanic and Latino students face systemic inequitable barriers in accessing a high-quality education and a fair shot at the American dream. Only 40 percent of Latino children participate in preschool education programs as compared to 53 percent of their White peers. Due to systemic and historical inequities faced in the classroom, the high school graduation rate for Hispanic students is below the national average. Hispanic students are underrepresented in advanced courses in mathematics and science, and they can face language barriers in the classroom. Only 19 percent of Latino adults have at least a bachelor's degree compared with 1 in 3 overall, and just 6 percent have completed graduate or professional degree programs, versus 13 percent nationally. Further, the lack of availability of adult continuing education courses makes it difficult for many Hispanic adults to further their education. In addition, barriers to equity in education can compound and intersect for Hispanic and Latino students who are women and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, English language learners, and individuals with disabilities.</FP>
    <FP>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated many of these inequities. Hispanic and Latino students are more likely than their White peers to experience remote learning arrangements, yet they have less access to the tools necessary to succeed, such as broadband and computer access. Hispanic women have been adversely impacted by job loss, a lack of access to child care, and the inability to provide care, in greater numbers than their White counterparts. These and pre-existing disparities have led to declines in student achievement for Hispanic students. Latino students—once 
        <PRTPAGE P="647"/>
        the fastest-growing group of undergraduates in the United States—have seen a decline in undergraduate college attendance amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID-19, and to provide Hispanic and Latino students with a successful return to the classroom.
    </FP>
    <FP>These barriers exist not simply in the classroom, but also in the workplace. Hispanic workers are overrepresented in industries that have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have faced disproportionate losses in employment. Hispanic and Latino workers often face discrimination in hiring, pay, and consideration for promotions among other challenges. They need greater access to work-based learning opportunities such as mentorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that not only guide employment seekers to a career, but provide the experience needed to secure well-paying jobs.</FP>
    <FP>To ensure that our Nation reaches the ambitious goals we have set for our economy to thrive, as well as to ensure equal access to opportunity for all, we must enable Hispanic and Latino students to reach their highest potential through our Nation's schools and institutions of higher education. The Federal Government must also collaborate with Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their long-term success.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Hispanic communities from early childhood until their chosen career.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Imposing Sanctions on Certain Persons With Respect to the Humanitarian and Human Rights Crisis in Ethiopia</HD>
    <FP>
        By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) (NEA), sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
    </FP>
    <FP>I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that the situation in and in relation to northern Ethiopia, which has been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region—in particular, widespread violence, atrocities, and serious human rights abuse, including those involving ethnic-based violence, rape and other forms of gender-based violence, and obstruction of humanitarian operations—constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.</FP>
    <FP>The widespread humanitarian crisis precipitated by the violent conflict in northern Ethiopia has left millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance and has placed an entire region on the brink of famine. While maintaining pressure on those persons responsible for the crisis, the United States will seek to ensure that appropriate personal remittances to non-blocked persons and humanitarian assistance to at-risk populations can flow to Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region through legitimate and transparent channels, including governments, international organizations, and non-profit organizations. The United States supports ongoing international efforts to promote a negotiated ceasefire and political resolution of this crisis, to ensure the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Ethiopia, and to promote the unity, territorial integrity, and stability of Ethiopia.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby order:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to impose any of the sanctions described in section 2(a) of this order on any foreign person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:

No entity shall be blocked pursuant to this order solely because it is owned in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by one or more sanctioned persons, unless the entity is itself a sanctioned person and the sanctions in section 2(a)(i)(A) of this order are imposed on the entity.</P>

        . For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked or affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         The United States has a unique political and legal relationship with federally recognized Tribal Nations, as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, statutes, treaties, Executive Orders, and court decisions. The Federal Government is committed to protecting the rights and ensuring the well-being of Tribal Nations while respecting Tribal sovereignty and inherent rights of self-determination. In recognition of that commitment and to fulfill the solemn obligations it entails, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must help advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Native American students, whether they attend public schools in urban, suburban, or rural communities; are homeschooled; attend primary and secondary schools operated or funded by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) of the Department of the Interior; or attend postsecondary educational institutions, including Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs).
    </FP>
    <FP>
        For more than a century, the United States imposed educational policies designed to assimilate Native peoples into predominant United States culture that devastated Native American students and their families. Beginning with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the United States enacted laws and implemented policies establishing and supporting Indian boarding schools across the Nation. From 1871 onward, federally run Indian boarding schools were used to culturally assimilate Native American children who were forcibly removed from their families and communities and relocated to distant residential facilities where their Native identities, languages, traditions, and beliefs were forcibly suppressed. The conditions in these schools were usually harsh, and sometimes abusive and deadly. Although these policies have ended, their effects and resulting trauma reverberate in Native American communities even today, creating specific challenges that merit Federal attention and response.
        <PRTPAGE P="664"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>During the global COVID-19 pandemic, Tribal Nations raced to protect Tribal members and their way of life. Tribal elders are often the keepers of Tribal culture and are critical for the preservation of Native languages, as the vitality of Native culture is inseparably tied to Native languages. Accordingly, my Administration is committed to supporting preservation and revitalization of Native languages. This includes honoring the vibrancy, importance, and strength of Native languages and the traditions, values, and cultural practices that accompany them.</FP>
    <FP>In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified long-standing educational inequities that disproportionally affect Native American communities and burden Native American students. In particular, Native American children face significant learning disruption as the digital divide and lack of educational resources put remote learning out of reach for too many. Native American students experienced the greatest decline in undergraduate enrollment in higher education from 2020 to 2021 compared to other student groups. These inequities compound the effects of other disparities faced by Native American women and girls in particular. The spike in gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified safety concerns for Native American women and girls, who were already victimized at higher rates than other women in the United States.</FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government must put strong focus on early childhood and K-12 educational opportunities. These are important to developing and strengthening Native American communities, and they set the stage for educational advancement and career development, including opportunities to attend TCUs.</FP>
    <FP>TCUs also merit focused attention, as these institutions are integral and essential to Tribal communities. Their foundation, tradition, and mission are unique, and their cultural grounding is invaluable to providing high-quality education and successful outcomes for Native American students. TCUs fulfill a vital role in maintaining and preserving irreplaceable Native languages and cultural traditions; in promoting excellence in Native American education from early childhood through primary and secondary education, into postsecondary education, and throughout graduates' careers; in offering an entry point for a career in academia, strong technical and trade school opportunities, job training, and other career-building programs to Native Americans; and in supporting Tribal economic development efforts by building and strengthening a highly skilled Native American workforce. Often, they are the only postsecondary institutions within some of our Nation's most economically disadvantaged and rural areas. As a result, TCUs provide crucial employment opportunities and services in communities that continue to suffer high rates of unemployment and resulting social and economic distress. The Federal Government therefore reaffirms and strengthens our commitment to Native American communities by investing in TCUs to support their continued growth and success.</FP>
    <FP>
        It is the policy of my Administration to advance equity, excellence, and justice in our Nation's education system and to further Tribal self-governance, including by supporting activities that expand educational opportunities and improve educational outcomes for all Native American students. My Administration will help expand opportunities for Native American students to learn their Native languages, histories, and cultural practices; promote indigenous learning through the use of traditional ecological 
        <PRTPAGE P="665"/>
        knowledge; and enhance access to complete and competitive educations that prepare Native American students for college, careers, and productive and satisfying lives. This includes supporting educational opportunities for students attending TCUs, given the unique advantages those institutions provide. My Administration is further committed to ensuring all Native American students have the ability to pursue careers that provide economic security for themselves and their families, including Native American women, who currently, on average, earn just 60 cents to every dollar earned by White men. To these ends, my Administration will collaborate with Tribal Nations to collect better data on educational attainment gaps faced by Native American students to help deepen understanding of these gaps, including barriers to workforce participation, and inform solutions.

         Educational opportunity is a fundamental element of the American promise. The United States Supreme Court recognized in 1954 in 
        <E T="03">Brown</E>
         v. 
        <E T="03">Board of Education</E>
         that education “is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.” In the decades since, our Nation has made progress in advancing equality and fairness in our schools, and the achievements, talents, and tenacity of Black students, educators, families, and scholars make our Nation's schools and communities stronger for all Americans. Black students are thriving in schools across the country, inside the classroom—as valedictorians and award-winning scientists—and outside of it, including in debate, athletics, student government, and national spelling bees, among many other areas.
    </FP>
    <FP>Over the course of America's history, Black Americans have helped to build, strengthen, and lead our Nation towards becoming a more perfect Union. Although for far too long, Black Americans were denied even the most basic access to education, the vital contributions of Black Americans in the fields of science, academia, business, and public service, among others, are a testament to the resilience of Black Americans and the steps our Nation has taken to expand access to education and opportunity.</FP>
    <FP>
        In spite of this progress, entrenched disparities continue to plague America's education system, holding far too many Black students back from achieving their full potential. Because of persistent racial and systemic injustices in our Nation, Black students remain more likely to attend high-poverty and racially segregated schools than White students. Black students are inequitably disciplined and suspended from school at disproportionately higher rates than White students for similar offenses. In addition, Black students too often face limited access to advanced and college-preparatory courses. Systemic racial disparities in education negatively impact learning outcomes for Black students and many face persistent gaps in reading and mathematics achievement. Studies show that school districts with high concentrations of Black students are much more likely to be underfunded than districts where a majority of students are White, and face much wider funding gaps, with an average deficit of more than $5,000 per student. Black students are still below the national average for educational attainment in high school, and that gap is even higher for college attainment rates, as 26 percent of Black Americans ages 25 and older have attained a bachelor's degree, while the national average is 36 percent.

        students also face unique challenges at the intersection of race and gender. Barriers to equity in education can compound for Black students who are also LGBTQ+ students, English-language learners, Dreamers, or students with disabilities.
    </FP>
    <FP>These disparities result in long-standing college and postsecondary educational attainment gaps that affect life outcomes and access to opportunities. Although student populations are becoming increasingly diverse, Black teachers remain significantly underrepresented in our Nation's classrooms. Educational inequities have only widened throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as Black students are more likely to experience remote learning challenges and greater learning loss as compared to their White peers. The persistent digital divide faced by some Black students has contributed to this disparity. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID-19, and to provide all students with a successful return to the classroom.</FP>
    <FP>In the face of these historic and present-day inequities in our Nation's schools, Black students continue to persevere. Black students and scholars today are breaking the barriers confronted by generations who came before. Our Nation's schools and communities are irrefutably strengthened by the success, scholarship, and tenacity of Black students of all ages. But our Nation must go further to finally root out systemic barriers in our schools.</FP>
    <FP>Additionally, these barriers are present not just in the classroom, but also in the workplace. Black Americans face systemic obstacles to getting good jobs, gaps in wages and promotion, and higher incidences of reported workplace discrimination than White workers. Eliminating these inequities requires expanding access to work-based learning and leadership opportunities, including mentorships, sponsorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that provide not only career guidance, but also the experience needed to navigate and excel in successful careers. In order for our Nation to equitably recover from the COVID-19 crisis, and to ensure that every Black person in America has a fair shot at the American dream, we must advance equity and excellence in public education and access to economic opportunities.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Black Americans and communities from early childhood until their chosen career.</FP>

         The United States needs resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains to ensure our economic prosperity, national security, and national competitiveness. In Executive Order 14017 of February 24, 2021 (America's Supply Chains), I directed a comprehensive review of America's supply chains to ensure that they are resilient in the face of a range of risks. One critical component of safeguarding supply chain resilience and industrial base health is ensuring that both the Federal Government and the private sector maintain adequate quantities of supplies, equipment, or raw materials on hand to create a buffer against potential shortages and import dependencies. Some of the Federal Government's key tools to maintain adequate quantities of supplies to guard against such shortages and dependencies are the United States national stockpiles, including the National Defense Stockpile. By strengthening the National Defense Stockpile, the Federal Government will both ensure that it is keeping adequate quantities of goods on hand and provide a model for the private sector, while recognizing that private sector stockpiles and reserves can differ from government ones. This order confers authority related to the release of strategic and critical materials from the National Defense Stockpile to improve Federal Government efforts around stockpiling for national defense purposes.

         The safety and well-being of all Native Americans is a top priority for my Administration. My Administration will work hand in hand with Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and healthy Tribal communities and to support comprehensive law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and support services.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        Generations of Native Americans have experienced violence or mourned a missing or murdered family member or loved one, and the lasting impacts 
        <PRTPAGE P="681"/>
        of such tragedies are felt throughout the country. Native Americans face unacceptably high levels of violence, and are victims of violent crime at a rate much higher than the national average. Native American women, in particular, are disproportionately the victims of sexual and gender-based violence, including intimate partner homicide. Research shows that approximately half of Native American women have experienced sexual violence and that approximately half have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner. LGBTQ+ Native Americans and people who identify as “Two-Spirit” people within Tribal communities are also often the targets of violence. And the vast majority of Native American survivors report being victimized by a non-Native American individual.
    </FP>
    <FP>For far too long, justice has been elusive for many Native American victims, survivors, and families. Criminal jurisdiction complexities and resource constraints have left many injustices unaddressed. Some progress has been made, particularly on Tribal lands. Given that approximately 70 percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives live in urban areas and part of this epidemic of violence is against Native American people in urban areas, we must continue that work on Tribal lands but also build on existing strategies to identify solutions directed toward the particular needs of urban Native Americans.</FP>
    <FP>In 2020, bipartisan members of the 116th Congress took an important step forward through the passage of two pieces of legislation—Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act of 2019—that include important provisions for improving law enforcement and justice protocols as well as improving access to data to address missing or murdered indigenous people. My Administration is committed to fully implementing these laws and working with the Congress to fund these programs for Native Americans. Earlier this year, the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General announced a Joint Commission, established pursuant to the Not Invisible Act, that includes: representatives of Tribal, State, and local law enforcement; Tribal judges; Native American survivors of human trafficking; health care and mental health practitioners who have experience working with Native American survivors of human trafficking and sexual assault; Urban Indian Organizations focused on violence against women and children; and family members of missing or murdered indigenous people. The Commission will work to address the persistent violence endured by Native American families and communities across the country. In addition, the Department of the Interior has established a special unit to focus resources on active and unsolved missing persons cases.</FP>
    <FP>
        But more work is needed to address the crisis of ongoing violence against Native Americans—and of missing or murdered indigenous people. Previous executive action has not achieved changes sufficient to reverse the epidemic of missing or murdered indigenous people and violence against Native Americans. The Federal Government must prioritize addressing this issue and its underlying causes, commit the resources needed to tackle the high rates of violent crime that Native Americans experience over the long term, coordinate and provide resources to collect and analyze data, and work closely with Tribal leaders and community members, Urban Indian Organizations, and other interested parties to support prevention and intervention efforts that will make a meaningful and lasting difference on the ground.
        <PRTPAGE P="682"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to work directly with Tribal Nations to strengthen public safety and criminal justice in Indian Country and beyond, to reduce violence against Native American people, and to ensure swift and effective Federal action that responds to the problem of missing or murdered indigenous people. My Administration understands that Native American people, particularly the survivors of violence, know best what their communities need to make them safer. Consistent engagement, commitment, and collaboration will drive long-term improvement to public safety for all Native Americans.</FP>

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same or similar services, the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are best served when the successor contractor or subcontractor hires the predecessor's employees, thus avoiding displacement of these employees. Using a carryover work force reduces disruption in the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors, maintains physical and information security, and provides the Federal Government with the benefits of an experienced and well-trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements. These same benefits are also often realized when a successor contractor or subcontractor performs the same or similar contract work at the same location where the predecessor contract was performed.

        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         The Federal Government faces broad exposure to the mounting risks and costs already posed by the climate crisis. In responding to this crisis, we have a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity to create and sustain jobs, including well-paying union jobs; support a just transition to a more sustainable economy for American workers; strengthen America's communities; protect public health; and advance environmental justice. As the single largest land owner, energy consumer, and employer in the Nation, the Federal Government can catalyze private sector investment and expand the economy and American industry by transforming how we build, buy, and manage electricity, vehicles, buildings, and other operations to be clean and sustainable.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        We also must build on past progress and pursue new strategies to improve the Nation's preparedness and resilience to the effects of a changing climate, including advancing the Federal Government's strategic planning, governance, financial management, and procurement to ensure climate resilient operations.
        <PRTPAGE P="695"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>It is therefore the policy of my Administration for the Federal Government to lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. Through a whole-of-government approach, we will demonstrate how innovation and environmental stewardship can protect our planet, safeguard Federal investments against the effects of climate change, respond to the needs of all of America's communities, and expand American technologies, industries, and jobs.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         Our Government must recommit to being “of the people, by the people, [and] for the people” in order to solve the complex 21st century challenges our Nation faces. Government must be held accountable for designing and delivering services with a focus on the actual experience of the people whom it is meant to serve. Government must also work to deliver services more equitably and effectively, especially for those who have been historically underserved. Strengthening the democratic process requires providing direct lines of feedback and mechanisms for engaging the American people in the design and improvement of Federal Government programs, processes, and services.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        As the United States faces critical challenges, including recovering from a global pandemic, promoting prosperity and economic growth, advancing equity, and tackling the climate crisis, the needs of the people of the United States, informed by, in particular, an understanding of how they experience Government, should drive priorities for service delivery improvements. In recent years, the annual paperwork burden imposed by executive departments and agencies (agencies) on the public has been in excess of 9 billion hours. That number is too high. Agencies must work with the Congress; the private sector and nonprofit organizations; State, local, Tribal, 
        <PRTPAGE P="705"/>
        and territorial governments; and other partners to design experiences with the Federal Government that effectively reduce administrative burdens, simplify both public-facing and internal processes to improve efficiency, and empower the Federal workforce to solve problems.
    </FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government must design and deliver services in a manner that people of all abilities can navigate. We must use technology to modernize Government and implement services that are simple to use, accessible, equitable, protective, transparent, and responsive for all people of the United States. When a disaster survivor, single parent, immigrant, small business owner, or veteran waits months for the Government to process benefits to which they are entitled, that lost time is a significant cost not only for that individual, but in the aggregate, for our Nation as a whole. This lost time operates as a kind of tax—a “time tax”—and it imposes a serious burden on our people as they interact with the Government. Improving Government services should also make our Government more efficient and effective overall.</FP>
    <FP>Every interaction between the Federal Government and the public, whether it involves renewing a passport or calling for a status update on a farm loan application, should be seen as an opportunity for the Government to save an individual's time (and thus reduce “time taxes”) and to deliver the level of service that the public expects and deserves. By demonstrating that its processes are effective and efficient, in addition to being fair, protective of privacy interests, and transparent, the Federal Government can build public trust. Further, the Federal Government's management of its customer experience and service delivery should be driven fundamentally by the voice of the customer through human-centered design methodologies; empirical customer research; an understanding of behavioral science and user testing, especially for digital services; and other mechanisms of engagement.</FP>
    <FP>
        Executive Order 12862 of September 11, 1993 (Setting Customer Service Standards), required agencies that provide significant services directly to the public to identify and gather feedback from customers; establish service standards and measure performance against those standards; and benchmark customer service performance against the best customer experience provided in the private sector. Executive Order 13571 of April 27, 2011 (Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service), further required agencies to develop a “Customer Service Plan . . . to address how the agency will provide services in a manner that seeks to streamline service delivery and improve the experience of its customers.” Executive Order 13707 of September 15, 2015 (Using Behavioral Science Insights To Better Serve the American People), called for the use of empirical findings in behavioral science fields to deliver better results for the American people, including by identifying “opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities, and businesses access public programs and benefits.” And Executive Order 13985 of January 20, 2021 (Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), established the policy of the Federal Government to “pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.” Consistent with these aims, agencies have begun assessing whether, and to what extent, their programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities 
        <PRTPAGE P="706"/>
        and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups. These previous actions have laid an important foundation for the policies and procedures set forth in this order. However, more is required to establish the sustained system for Federal Government accountability and performance necessary to drive an ongoing focus on improved delivery and results for the people of the United States.

    <FP>
        <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         It is the policy of the United States that, in a Government of the people, by the people, and for the people, improving service delivery and customer experience should be fundamental priorities. The Government's performance must be measured empirically and by on-the-ground results for the people of the United States, especially for their experiences with services delivered. The means of Government—such as its budget, policy, financial management, procurement, and human resources practices—must work to achieve those ends. Agencies should continually improve their understanding of their customers, reduce administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens to minimize “time taxes,” enhance transparency, create greater efficiencies across Government, and redesign compliance-oriented processes to improve customer experience and more directly meet the needs of the people of the United States. Consistent with the purpose described in section 1 of this order, agencies' efforts to improve customer experience should include systematically identifying and resolving the root causes of customer experience challenges, regardless of whether the source of such challenges is statutory, regulatory, budgetary, technological, or process-based. Furthermore, to engender public trust, agencies must ensure that their efforts appropriately maintain or enhance protections afforded under law and policy, including those related to civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, confidentiality, and information security.

    <FP>I, JOSEPH R.

Drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators are the primary sources of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that fuel the current opioid epidemic, as well as drug-related violence that harms our communities. I find that international drug trafficking—including the illicit production, global sale, and widespread distribution of illegal drugs; the rise of extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids; as well as the growing role of Internet-based drug sales—constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This serious threat requires our country to modernize and update our response to drug trafficking. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.</FP>

    <EAR>EO 14060</EAR>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing the United States Council on Transnational Organized Crime</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>
        . 
        <E T="03">Purpose.</E>
         Transnational organized crime (TOC) poses a direct and escalating threat to public health, public safety, and national security. Transnational criminal organizations engage in a broad range of criminal activities, including drug and weapons trafficking, migrant smuggling, human trafficking, cybercrime, intellectual property theft, money laundering, wildlife and timber trafficking, illegal fishing, and illegal mining.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        These networks continue to expand in size and influence in the United States and abroad. Transnational criminal organizations contribute directly to tens of thousands of drug-overdose deaths in the United States each year and adversely affect American communities and economic prosperity. They also threaten United States national security by degrading the security and stability of allied and partner nations, undermining the rule of law, fostering corruption, acting as proxies for hostile state activities, directly or indirectly funding insurgent and terrorist groups, depleting natural resources, harming human health and the environment, contributing to climate change through illegal deforestation and logging, and exploiting and endangering vulnerable populations. In some regions, transnational criminal organizations wield state-like capabilities, disregarding sovereign borders, compromising the integrity of democratic institutions and threatening the legitimacy of fragile governments, and securing their power through intimidation, corruption, and violence. For these reasons, it is in the national interest of the United States to counter TOC. Addressing TOC requires a coordinated Federal framework accompanied by a cohesive whole-of-government effort executed in collaboration with State, local, Tribal, territorial, and civil society partners in the United States and in close coordination with foreign partners, international and regional organizations, and international and local civil society groups abroad.

         Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take actions within their respective authorities, including, as appropriate, through the provision of technical and financial assistance, to enhance efforts to counter TOC. It is the policy of the United States to:
    </FP>
    <P>(a) employ authorized intelligence and operational capabilities in an integrated manner to target, disrupt, and degrade transnational criminal organizations that pose the greatest threat to national security;</P>
    <P>(b) collaborate with private entities and international, multilateral, and bilateral organizations to combat TOC, while also strengthening cooperation with and advancing efforts to build capacity in partner nations to reduce transnational criminal activity;</P>
    <P>(c) improve information sharing between law enforcement entities and the Intelligence Community to enhance strategic analysis of, and efforts to combat, transnational criminal organizations and their activities, while also preserving our ability to speedily bring TOC actors to justice;</P>
    <P>(d) expand tools and capabilities to combat illicit finance, which underpins all TOC activities; and</P>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Southern Border of the United States</HD>
    <FP>On February 15, 2019, by Proclamation 9844, I declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States to deal with the border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests.</FP>
    <FP>The ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border of the United States continues to threaten our national security, including by exacerbating the effect of the pandemic caused by COVID-19. The executive branch has taken steps to address the crisis, but further action is needed to address the humanitarian crisis and to control unlawful migration and the flow of narcotics and criminals across the southern border of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>For these reasons, the national emergency declared on February 15, 2019, and the measures adopted on that date to respond to that emergency, must continue in effect beyond February 15, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9844 concerning the southern border of the United States.</FP>

        <E T="03">Declassification and Release.</E>
         At my request, on December 30, 2020, the Department of Justice provided the White House with a binder of materials related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Portions of the documents in the binder have remained classified and have not been released to the Congress or the public. I requested the documents so that a declassification review could be performed and so I could determine to what extent materials in the binder should be released in unclassified form.
    </FP>
    <FP>
        I determined that the materials in that binder should be declassified to the maximum extent possible. In response, and as part of the iterative process 
        <PRTPAGE P="743"/>
        of the declassification review, under a cover letter dated January 17, 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation noted its continuing objection to any further declassification of the materials in the binder and also, on the basis of a review that included Intelligence Community equities, identified the passages that it believed it was most crucial to keep from public disclosure. I have determined to accept the redactions proposed for continued classification by the FBI in that January 17 submission.
    </FP>
    <FP>I hereby declassify the remaining materials in the binder. This is my final determination under the declassification review and I have directed the Attorney General to implement the redactions proposed in the FBI's January 17 submission and return to the White House an appropriately redacted copy.</FP>
    <FP>My decision to declassify materials within the binder is subject to the limits identified above and does not extend to materials that must be protected from disclosure pursuant to orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and does not require the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information or any other materials that must be protected from disclosure under applicable law. Accordingly, at my direction, the Attorney General has conducted an appropriate review to ensure that materials provided in the binder may be disclosed by the White House in accordance with applicable law.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Venezuelans</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security</HD>
    <FP>The autocratic government of Nicolas Maduro has consistently violated the sovereign freedoms possessed by the Venezuelan people. Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory. A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.</FP>
    <FP>This Administration has imposed sanctions against Maduro and his regime, and I have recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the interim president of the country. The deteriorative condition within Venezuela, which presents an ongoing national security threat to the safety and well-being of the American people, warrants the deferral of the removal of Venezuelan nationals who are present in the United States.</FP>
    <FP>Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer the removal of any national of Venezuela, or alien without nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela, subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby direct you to take appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any national of Venezuela, or alien without nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela, who is present in the United States as of January 20, 2021, except for aliens who:</FP>
    <P>(1) have voluntarily returned to Venezuela or their country of last habitual residence outside the United States;</P>
    <P>(2) have not continuously resided in the United States since January 20, 2021;</P>
    <P>(3) are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or removable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));</P>
    <P>(4) who have been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));</P>
    <P>(5) who were deported, excluded, or removed, prior to January 20, 2021;</P>
    <P>(6) who are subject to extradition;</P>
    <P>(7) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or</P>
    <P>
        (8) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.
        <PRTPAGE P="745"/>

    <FP>I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for aliens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Reinstating Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberians</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security</HD>
    <FP>Since 1991, the United States has provided safe haven for Liberians who were forced to flee their country as a result of armed conflict and widespread civil strife, in part through the grant of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The armed conflict ended in 2003, and TPS for affected Liberian nationals ended effective October 1, 2007. President Bush then deferred the enforced departure of those Liberians originally granted TPS. President Obama, in successive memoranda, extended that grant of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) to March 31, 2018. President Trump then determined that conditions in Liberia did not warrant a further extension of DED, but that the foreign policy interests of the United States warranted affording an orderly transition period for Liberian DED beneficiaries. President Trump later extended that DED transition period through March 30, 2020.</FP>
    <FP>In December 2019, the Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92) (NDAA), which included, as section 7611, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF) provision. The LRIF provision, with limited exceptions, makes Liberians who have been continuously present in the United States since November 20, 2014, as well as their spouses and children, eligible for adjustment of status to that of United States lawful permanent resident (LPR). The NDAA gave eligible Liberian nationals until December 20, 2020, to apply for this adjustment of status. After the enactment of the LRIF provision, President Trump further extended the DED transition period through January 10, 2021, to ensure that DED beneficiaries would continue to be eligible for employment authorization during the LRIF application period.</FP>
    <FP>
        The LRIF application process was hampered by a slow launch, cumbersome procedures, and delays in adjudication. Recognizing these difficulties, the Congress enacted a 1-year extension to the application period in section 901 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260). That legislation, however, did not provide for continued employment authorization past January 10, 2021, the expiration of the most recent DED transition period.
        <PRTPAGE P="746"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>There are compelling foreign policy reasons to reinstate DED for an additional period for those Liberians presently residing in the United States who were under a grant of DED as of January 10, 2021. Providing work authorization to these Liberians, for whom we have long authorized TPS or DED in the United States, while they initiate and complete the LRIF status-adjustment process, honors the historic close relationship between the United States and Liberia and is in the foreign policy interests of the United States. I urge all Liberian DED beneficiaries to apply promptly for adjustment of status, and I direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to review the LRIF application procedures administered by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to ensure that they facilitate ease of application and timely adjudication.</FP>
    <FP>Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interests of the United States to defer through June 30, 2022, the removal of any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who is present in the United States and who was under a grant of DED as of January 10, 2021. I have also determined that any Liberian national, or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who is present in the United States and who was under a grant of DED as of January 10, 2021, should have continued employment authorization through June 30, 2022.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly direct the appropriate officials to make provision, by means of a notice published in the 
        <E T="03">Federal Register</E>
        , for immediate allowance of employment authorization for those Liberians who held appropriate DED-related employment authorization documents as of January 10, 2021. The Secretary shall also provide for the prompt issuance of new or replacement documents in appropriate cases.
    </FP>
    <FP>This grant of DED and continued employment authorization shall apply to any Liberian DED beneficiary as of January 10, 2021, but shall not apply to such persons in the following categories:</FP>
    <P>(1) Individuals who would be ineligible for TPS for the reasons provided in section 244(c)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B);</P>
    <P>(2) Individuals who sought or seek LPR status under the LRIF provision but whose applications have been or are denied by the Secretary of Homeland Security;</P>
    <P>(3) Individuals whose removal the Secretary of Homeland Security determines is in the interest of the United States, subject to the LRIF provision;</P>
    <P>(4) Individuals whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States;</P>
    <P>(5) Individuals who have voluntarily returned to Liberia or their country of last habitual residence outside the United States for an aggregate period of 180 days or more, as specified in subsection (c)(2) of the LRIF provision;</P>
    <P>(6) Individuals who were deported, excluded, or removed prior to the date of this memorandum; or</P>
    <P>
        (7) Individuals who are subject to extradition.
        <PRTPAGE P="747"/>
    </P>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take the necessary steps to implement for eligible Liberians:</FP>
    <P>(1) a deferral of enforced departure from the United States through June 30, 2022, effective immediately; and</P>
    <P>(2) authorization for employment valid through June 30, 2022.</P>

         In 2012, during the Obama-Biden Administration, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum outlining how, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the Department of Homeland Security should enforce the Nation's immigration laws against certain young people. This memorandum, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) guidance, deferred the removal of certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, have obeyed the law, and stayed in school or enlisted in the military. DACA and associated regulations permit eligible individuals who pass a background check to request temporary relief from removal and to apply for temporary work permits. DACA reflects a judgment that these immigrants should not be a priority for removal based on humanitarian concerns and other considerations, and that work authorization will enable them to support themselves and their families, and to contribute to our economy, while they remain.

        <E T="03">Background.</E>
         For nearly four decades, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been charged by Presidents of both parties with reviewing significant executive branch regulatory actions. This process is largely governed by Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended. This memorandum reaffirms the basic principles set forth in that order and in Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), which took important steps towards modernizing the regulatory review process. When carried out properly, that process can help to advance regulatory policies that improve the lives of the American people.
    </FP>
    <FP>Our Nation today faces serious challenges, including a massive global pandemic; a major economic downturn; systemic racial inequality; and the undeniable reality and accelerating threat of climate change. It is the policy of my Administration to mobilize the power of the Federal Government to rebuild our Nation and address these and other challenges. As we do so, it is important that we evaluate the processes and principles that govern regulatory review to ensure swift and effective Federal action. Regulations that promote the public interest are vital for tackling national priorities.</FP>

These recommendations should provide concrete suggestions on how the regulatory review process can promote public health and safety, economic growth, social welfare, racial justice, environmental stewardship, human dignity, equity, and the interests of future generations.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
    <FP>
        Advancing inclusion and belonging for people of all races, national origins, and ethnicities is critical to guaranteeing the safety and security of the American people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric has put Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) persons, families, communities, and businesses at risk.
        <PRTPAGE P="752"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons. These actions defied the best practices and guidelines of public health officials and have caused significant harm to AAPI families and communities that must be addressed.</FP>
    <FP>Despite these increasing acts of intolerance, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made our Nation more secure during the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout our history. An estimated 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have served on the front lines of this crisis as healthcare providers, as first responders, and in other essential roles. The Federal Government should combat racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and should work to ensure that all members of AAPI communities—no matter their background, the language they speak, or their religious beliefs—are treated with dignity and equity.</FP>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1</E>

        <E T="03">Condemning Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.</E>

In developing any such guidance, the Secretary should consider the best practices set forth by public health organizations and experts for mitigating racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that official actions, documents, and statements, including those that pertain to the COVID-19 pandemic, do not exhibit or contribute to racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Agencies may consult with public health experts, AAPI community leaders, or AAPI community-serving organizations, or may refer to any best practices issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to ensure an understanding of the needs and challenges faced by AAPI communities.</P>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Redressing Our Nation's and the Federal Government's History of Discriminatory Housing Practices and Policies</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
         
        <E T="03">Background and Policy.</E>
         Diverse and inclusive communities strengthen our democracy. But our Nation's history has been one of great struggle toward this ideal. During the 20th century, Federal, State, and local governments systematically implemented racially discriminatory housing policies that contributed to segregated neighborhoods and inhibited equal opportunity and the chance to build wealth for Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native American families, and other underserved communities. Ongoing legacies of residential segregation and discrimination remain ever-present in our society. These include a racial gap in homeownership; a persistent undervaluation of properties owned by families of color; a disproportionate burden of pollution and exposure to the impacts of climate change in communities of color; and systemic barriers to safe, accessible, and affordable housing for people of 
        <PRTPAGE P="754"/>
        color, immigrants, individuals with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender non-conforming, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals.
    </FP>
    <FP>Throughout much of the 20th century, the Federal Government systematically supported discrimination and exclusion in housing and mortgage lending. While many of the Federal Government's housing policies and programs expanded homeownership across the country, many knowingly excluded Black people and other persons of color, and promoted and reinforced housing segregation. Federal policies contributed to mortgage redlining and lending discrimination against persons of color.</FP>
    <FP>The creation of the Interstate Highway System, funded and constructed by the Federal Government and State governments in the 20th century, disproportionately burdened many historically Black and low-income neighborhoods in many American cities. Many urban interstate highways were deliberately built to pass through Black neighborhoods, often requiring the destruction of housing and other local institutions. To this day, many Black neighborhoods are disconnected from access to high-quality housing, jobs, public transit, and other resources.</FP>
    <FP>The Federal Government must recognize and acknowledge its role in systematically declining to invest in communities of color and preventing residents of those communities from accessing the same services and resources as their white counterparts. The effects of these policy decisions continue to be felt today, as racial inequality still permeates land-use patterns in most U.S. cities and virtually all aspects of housing markets.</FP>
    <FP>The Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act more than 50 years ago to lift barriers that created separate and unequal neighborhoods on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin. Since then, however, access to housing and the creation of wealth through homeownership have remained persistently unequal in the United States. Many neighborhoods are as racially segregated today as they were in the middle of the 20th century. People of color are overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness. In addition, people of color disproportionately bear the burdens of exposure to air and water pollution, and growing risks of housing instability from climate crises like extreme heat, flooding, and wildfires. And the racial wealth gap is wider than it was when the Fair Housing Act was enacted, driven in part by persistent disparities in access to homeownership. Although Federal fair housing laws were expanded to include protections for individuals with disabilities, a lack of access to affordable and integrated living options remains a significant problem.</FP>
    <FP>
        The Federal Government has a critical role to play in overcoming and redressing this history of discrimination and in protecting against other forms of discrimination by applying and enforcing Federal civil rights and fair housing laws. It can help ensure that fair and equal access to housing opportunity exists for all throughout the United States. This goal is consistent with the Fair Housing Act, which imposes on Federal departments and agencies the duty to “administer their programs and activities relating to housing and urban development . . . in a manner affirmatively to further” fair housing (42 U.S.C. 3608(d)). This is not only a mandate to refrain from discrimination but a mandate to take actions that undo historic patterns of segregation and other types of discrimination and that afford access to long-denied opportunities.
        <PRTPAGE P="755"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, it is the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government shall work with communities to end housing discrimination, to provide redress to those who have experienced housing discrimination, to eliminate racial bias and other forms of discrimination in all stages of home-buying and renting, to lift barriers that restrict housing and neighborhood choice, to promote diverse and inclusive communities, to ensure sufficient physically accessible housing, and to secure equal access to housing opportunity for all.</FP>

The Secretary shall also, as soon as practicable, take all steps necessary to examine the effects of the September 24, 2020, rule entitled “HUD's Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Disparate Impact Standard” (codified at part 100 of title 24, Code of Federal Regulations), including the effect that amending the February 15, 2013, rule entitled “Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard” has had on HUD's statutory duty to ensure compliance with the Fair Housing Act. Based on that examination, the Secretary shall take any necessary steps, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to implement the Fair Housing Act's requirements that HUD administer its programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing and HUD's overall duty to administer the Act (42 U.S.C. 3608(a)) including by preventing practices with an unjustified discriminatory effect.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation Relationships</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</HD>
    <FP>American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations are sovereign governments recognized under the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and court decisions. It is a priority of my Administration to make respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, commitment to fulfilling Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, and regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations cornerstones of Federal Indian policy. The United States has made solemn promises to Tribal Nations for more than two centuries. Honoring those commitments is particularly vital now, as our Nation faces crises related to health, the economy, racial justice, and climate change—all of which disproportionately harm Native Americans. History demonstrates that we best serve Native American people when Tribal governments are empowered to lead their communities, and when Federal officials speak with and listen to Tribal leaders in formulating Federal policy that affects Tribal Nations.</FP>
    <FP>To this end, Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments), charges all executive departments and agencies with engaging in regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have Tribal implications. Tribal consultation under this order strengthens the Nation-to-Nation relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations. The Presidential Memorandum of November 5, 2009 (Tribal Consultation), requires each agency to prepare and periodically update a detailed plan of action to implement the policies and directives of Executive Order 13175. This memorandum reaffirms the policy announced in that memorandum.</FP>

        It is the policy of my Administration to make evidence-based decisions guided by the best available science and data. Scientific and technological information, data, and evidence are central to the development and iterative improvement of sound policies, and to the delivery of equitable programs, across every area of government. Scientific findings should never be distorted or influenced by political considerations. When scientific or technological information is considered in policy decisions, it should be 
        <PRTPAGE P="758"/>
        subjected to well-established scientific processes, including peer review where feasible and appropriate, with appropriate protections for privacy. Improper political interference in the work of Federal scientists or other scientists who support the work of the Federal Government and in the communication of scientific facts undermines the welfare of the Nation, contributes to systemic inequities and injustices, and violates the trust that the public places in government to best serve its collective interests.

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         Women should have access to the healthcare they need. For too many women today, both at home and abroad, that is not possible. Undue restrictions on the use of Federal funds have made it harder for women to obtain necessary healthcare. The Federal Government must take 
        <PRTPAGE P="765"/>
        action to ensure that women at home and around the world are able to access complete medical information, including with respect to their reproductive health.
    </FP>
    <FP>In the United States, Title X of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 300 to 300a-6) provides Federal funding for family planning services that primarily benefit low-income patients. The Act specifies that Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning, but places no further abortion-related restrictions on recipients of Title X funds. See 42 U.S.C. 300a-6. In 2019, the Secretary of Health and Human Services finalized changes to regulations governing the Title X program and issued a final rule entitled “Compliance With Statutory Program Integrity Requirements,” 84 FR 7714 (Mar. 4, 2019) (Title X Rule), which prohibits recipients of Title X funds from referring patients to abortion providers and imposes other onerous requirements on abortion providers. The Title X Rule has caused the termination of Federal family planning funding for many women's healthcare providers and puts women's health at risk by making it harder for women to receive complete medical information.</FP>
    <FP>It is the policy of my Administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1)), prohibits nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that receive Federal funds from using those funds “to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning, or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.” The August 1984 announcement by President Reagan of what has become known as the “Mexico City Policy” directed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to expand this limitation and withhold USAID family planning funds from NGOs that use non-USAID funds to perform abortions, provide advice, counseling, or information regarding abortion, or lobby a foreign government to legalize abortion or make abortion services more easily available. These restrictions were rescinded by President Clinton in 1993, reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001, and rescinded by President Obama in 2009. President Trump substantially expanded these restrictions by applying the policy to global health assistance provided by all executive departments and agencies (agencies). These excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the United States' efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability to support women's health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence. The expansion of the policy has also affected all other areas of global health assistance, limiting the United States' ability to work with local partners around the world and inhibiting their efforts to confront serious health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others. Such restrictions on global health assistance are particularly harmful in light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Accordingly, I hereby order as follows:</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya</HD>
    <FP>On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, which took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his family, or his close associates if those assets were not protected. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the attacks caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability.</FP>
    <FP>
        The situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures are needed to protect against the diversion of assets or other abuses by members of Qadhafi's family, their associates, and other persons hindering Libyan national reconciliation.

    <FP>For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 25, 2011, must continue in effect beyond February 25, 2021.

        On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two unarmed United States-registered, civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. On February 24, 2016, by Proclamation 9398, and on February 22, 2018, by Proclamation 9699, the national emergency was further modified based on continued disturbances or threatened 
        <PRTPAGE P="773"/>
        disturbances of the international relations of the United States related to Cuba. The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the use of excessive force against United States vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba.
    </FP>
    <FP>Further, the unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States because such entry could facilitate a mass migration from Cuba. It continues to be United States policy that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger United States national security by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699.</FP>

    <FP>On April 3, 2014, by Executive Order 13664, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in and in relation to South Sudan, which has been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, or stability of South Sudan and the surrounding region, including widespread violence and atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations.</FP>
    <FP>
        The situation in and in relation to South Sudan continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on April 3, 2014, must continue in effect beyond April 3, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664.

    <FP>On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have been the subject of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.</FP>
    <FP>On July 20, 2012, the President issued Executive Order 13620 to take additional steps to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2036 of February 22, 2012, and Resolution 2002 of July 29, 2011, and to address: exports of charcoal from Somalia, which generate significant revenue for al-Shabaab; the misappropriation of Somali public assets; and certain acts of violence committed against civilians in Somalia, all of which contribute to the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia.</FP>
    <FP>The situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in accordance with section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) (8 U.S.C. 1157(b)), and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I have determined that subsequent to the signing of Presidential Determination 2021-02 on October 27, 2020 (Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021) (PD 2021-02), an unforeseen emergency refugee situation now exists due to new or increasing political violence, repression, atrocities, or humanitarian crises in countries including Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Hong Kong and Xinjiang (China), South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela, as well as changing conditions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. I have further determined that the allocation of admissions among refugees of humanitarian concern set forth in PD 2021-02 prevents the United States Refugee Admissions Program from responding to this unforeseen emergency refugee situation. I hereby make the following determinations and direct the following actions:</FP>
    <P>(a) In response to the emergency refugee situation, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 allocation of admissions among refugees of humanitarian concern to the United States shall be revised as set forth in section (b) of this determination. This action is justified by grave humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest. Further, the admission of refugees affected by the emergency refugee situation cannot be accomplished under section 207(a) of the Act.</P>

    <FP>
        In Executive Order 14013 of February 4, 2021 (Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration), I directed numerous actions to rebuild, expand, and improve the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). On February 12, 2021, the Department of State submitted a report to certain congressional committees and, with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, consulted with the Congress regarding a proposal to re-allocate admissions among refugees of humanitarian concern and to increase Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 refugee admissions from 15,000 refugees to 62,500 refugees due to an unforeseen emergency refugee situation in countries around the globe since the signing of 
        <PRTPAGE P="781"/>
        Presidential Determination 2021-02 on October 27, 2020 (Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021) (PD 2021-02).
    </FP>
    <FP>In Presidential Determination 2021-05 of April 16, 2021 (Emergency Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2021) (PD 2021-05), I changed the allocation of admissions in PD 2021-02 based on a determination that new allocations were necessary to respond to the unforeseen emergency refugee situation. Based on this change, USRAP partners are beginning travel preparations for more than 2,000 refugees who were excluded under PD 2021-02, but who can now be admitted to the United States.</FP>
    <FP>In PD 2021-05, I did not change the pre-existing number of refugee admissions permitted for FY 2021, which remained at 15,000. I also stated that I would consider raising the worldwide refugee admissions ceiling before the end of FY 2021, should the pre-existing level be reached and the emergency refugee situation persist. When I signed PD 2021-05, my intent was to adjust only the allocation of admissions and to address the appropriate number of refugees in a separate determination. Upon additional briefing and a more comprehensive presentation regarding the capacity of the executive departments and agencies charged with administering USRAP to increase refugee admissions while responding to other demands, and given the ongoing unforeseen emergency refugee situation, I now determine, consistent with my Administration's prior consultation with the Congress, that raising the number of admissions permissible for FY 2021 to 62,500 is justified by grave humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest.</FP>
    <FP>The number of refugee admissions authorized by this determination under section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(b)) sends the important message that the United States remains a safe harbor for some of the most vulnerable people in the world. This number also sets a goal for USRAP and the non-governmental and international organizations with whom USRAP partners to resettle refugees. Given the gravity of the global refugee crisis, the number of authorized refugee admissions must be ambitious enough to challenge the United States Government and its partners to build their capacity to serve more refugees. In my judgment, a refugee admissions determination of 62,500 reflects these values, is justified by grave humanitarian concerns, and is otherwise in the national interest of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>The FY 2021 allocations set forth in section (b) of PD 2021-05 are adjusted as follows:</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of the Government of Syria</HD>
    <FP>On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.</FP>
    <FP>The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.</FP>
    <FP>
        The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have called for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical weapons and supporting terrorist organizations, pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; on February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460; on April 29, 2011, in Executive Order 13572; on May 18, 2011, in Executive Order 13573; on August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.
        <PRTPAGE P="783"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>In addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's, and its Russian and Iranian enablers', brutal violence and human rights violations and abuses. The United States calls on the Assad regime and its backers to stop its violent war against its own people, enact a nationwide ceasefire, enable the unobstructed delivery of humanitarian assistance to all Syrians in need, and negotiate a political settlement in Syria in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. The United States will consider changes in policies and actions of the Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency in the future.</FP>

         This Nation was founded on the ideal of equal justice under the law. Everyone in this country should be able to vindicate their rights and avail themselves of the protections that our laws afford on equal footing. Whether we realize this ideal hinges on the extent to which everyone in the United States has meaningful access to our legal system. Legal services are crucial to the fair and effective administration of our laws and public programs, and the stability of our society.
    </FP>
    <FP>Recognizing the importance of access to justice and the power of legal aid, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2010 launched an access-to-justice initiative. In 2016, DOJ formally established the Office for Access to Justice. This office worked in partnership with other DOJ components to coordinate policy initiatives on topics including criminal indigent defense, enforcement of fines and fees, language barriers in access to the courts, and civil legal aid. The DOJ and the White House Domestic Policy Council also launched the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (LAIR) in 2012 to work with civil legal aid partners to advance Federal programs; create and disseminate tools to provide information about civil legal aid and Federal funding opportunities; and generate research to inform policy that improves access to justice.</FP>
    <FP>The LAIR's successes prompted President Obama to issue the memorandum of September 24, 2015 (Establishment of the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable), which formally established LAIR as a White House initiative. Using the White House's convening power, LAIR examined innovative and evidence-based solutions for access to justice, from medical-legal partnerships to improve health outcomes and decrease health costs to better procedures in court hearings for individuals representing themselves.</FP>
    <FP>But there is much more for the Federal Government to do. According to a 2017 study by the Legal Services Corporation, low-income Americans receive inadequate or no professional legal assistance with regard to over 80 percent of the civil legal problems they face in a given year. All too often, unaddressed legal issues push people into poverty. At the same time, in the criminal legal system, those who cannot afford private counsel often receive a lower-quality defense because public defender caseloads are overburdened.</FP>
    <FP>
        The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated inequities in our justice system, as courts and legal service providers have been forced to curtail in-person operations, often without the resources or technology to offer remote-access or other safe alternatives. 
        <PRTPAGE P="787"/>
        These access limitations have compounded the effects of other harms wrought by the pandemic. These problems have touched the lives of many persons in this country, particularly low-income people and people of color.
    </FP>
    <FP>With these immense and urgent challenges comes the opportunity to strengthen access to justice in the 21st century. Through funding, interagency collaboration, and strategic partnerships, the Federal Government can drive development of new approaches and best practices that provide meaningful access to justice today, and into the future, consistent with our foundational ideal of equal justice under the law.</FP>

    <FP>On September 20, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13810 to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its intercontinental ballistic missile launches of July 3 and July 28, 2017, and its nuclear test of September 2, 2017; its commission of serious human rights abuses; and its use of funds generated through international trade to support its nuclear and missile programs and weapons proliferation.</FP>
    <FP>The existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Hong Kong Residents</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Homeland Security</HD>
    <FP>The United States supports the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the residents of Hong Kong. Recognizing the significant erosion of those rights and freedoms in Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China (PRC), I am directing the deferral of removal of certain Hong Kong residents who are present in the United States.</FP>
    <FP>
        By unilaterally imposing on Hong Kong the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL), the PRC has undermined the enjoyment of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including those protected under the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Since the imposition of the NSL in June 2020, Hong Kong police have continued a campaign of politically motivated arrests, taking into custody at least 100 opposition politicians, activists, and protesters on NSL-related charges including secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or external 
        <PRTPAGE P="802"/>
        elements. Over 10,000 individuals have been arrested for other charges in connection with anti-government protests. Over the last year, the PRC has continued its assault on Hong Kong's autonomy, undermining its remaining democratic processes and institutions, imposing limits on academic freedom, and cracking down on freedom of the press.
    </FP>
    <FP>There are compelling foreign policy reasons to defer enforced departure for Hong Kong residents presently in the United States. The United States is committed to a foreign policy that unites our democratic values with our foreign policy goals, which is centered on the defense of democracy and the promotion of human rights around the world. Offering safe haven for Hong Kong residents who have been deprived of their guaranteed freedoms in Hong Kong furthers United States interests in the region. The United States will not waver in our support of people in Hong Kong.</FP>
    <FP>Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any Hong Kong resident subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.</FP>
    <FP>Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any Hong Kong resident who is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum, except for those:</FP>
    <P>(1) who have voluntarily returned to Hong Kong or the PRC after the date of this memorandum;</P>
    <P>(2) who have not continuously resided in the United States since the date of this memorandum;</P>
    <P>(3) who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));</P>
    <P>(4) who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));</P>
    <P>(5) who are subject to extradition;</P>
    <P>(6) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or</P>
    <P>(7) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.</P>
    <FP>
        I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of Education</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
    <FP>
        <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
         
        <E T="03">Policy</E>
        . As the school year starts across the country, a top priority of my Administration is to do everything in our power to ensure a safe return to full-time, in-person school for our Nation's children. With increased access to vaccinations for school staff and students age 12 and older, proven virus prevention strategies, and unprecedented resources from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2) (American Rescue Plan) and other Federal pandemic relief funds, opening all schools this fall for full-time, in-person learning is essential. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made clear that, with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant driving an increase in COVID-19 cases nationally, it is critical for schools to protect students against exposure, especially given the number of children who are ineligible to obtain the vaccine at this time. The CDC has provided clear guidance to schools on how to adopt science-based strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the Department of Education has provided guidance to schools on how to reopen safely while addressing the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of our Nation's students.
    </FP>
    <FP>Many Governors and other State and local officials have risen to the challenge of beginning the new school year safely and responsibly by implementing prevention and mitigation strategies to maximize the health and safety of students, educators, and staff. The Federal Government is supporting these efforts in critical ways. The American Rescue Plan provides significant support to schools to develop and implement science-based health protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is reimbursing States, including their school districts, at 100 percent Federal cost share to support the safe reopening and operation of school facilities and to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and staff.</FP>
    <FP>At the same time, however, some State governments have adopted policies and laws that interfere with the ability of schools and districts to keep our children safe during in-person learning. Some of these policies and laws have gone so far as to try to block school officials from adopting safety protocols aligned with recommendations from the CDC to protect students, educators, and staff. And some State officials have even threatened to impose personal financial consequences on school officials who are working tirelessly to put student health and safety first and to comply with their legal obligations to their communities to further the essential goal of a safe, in-person education for all students.</FP>
    <FP>Our priority must be the safety of students, families, educators, and staff in our school communities. Nothing should interfere with this goal.</FP>

    <FP>
        On September 12, 2018, by Executive Order 13848, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the threat of foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in United States elections.
    </FP>
    <FP>Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcomes or vote tabulation in any United States election, foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America's free and open political system. In recent years, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has created significant vulnerabilities and magnified the scope and intensity of the threat of foreign interference. The ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on September 12, 2018, must continue in effect beyond September 12, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848 with respect to the threat of foreign interference in or undermining public confidence in United States elections.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2022</HD>
    <HD SOURCE="HED">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</HD>
    <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.</FP>
    <FP>A country's presence on the foregoing list is neither a reflection of its government's counterdrug efforts nor level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or major illicit drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (Public Law 87-195) (FAA), the reason countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures.</FP>
    <FP>
        Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as having failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts during the previous 12 months to both adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take the measures required by 
        <PRTPAGE P="812"/>
        section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included with this determination are justifications for the designations of Bolivia and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA. I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that United States programs that support Bolivia and Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.
    </FP>
    <FP>The ongoing drug addiction and overdose epidemic in the United States is one of the foremost public health priorities of my Administration, and addressing this epidemic will require both new domestic investments and greater cooperation with foreign partners to target illicit drug suppliers and the criminal organizations that profit from them. While creating our first-year drug policy priorities, my Administration outlined a strategy that includes expanding access to prevention, treatment, evidence-based harm reduction, and recovery support services in order to curb the drug addiction and overdose epidemic. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is an investment in these priorities, committing nearly $4 billion to support behavioral health and substance use disorder programs.</FP>
    <FP>My Administration's Fiscal Year 2022 Budget request itemizes $10.7 billion to support research, prevention, treatment, evidence-based harm reduction, and recovery support services, with targeted investments to meet the needs of populations at greatest risk for overdose and substance use disorder. The Budget request also includes significant investments to reduce the supply of illicit drugs originating from beyond our borders.</FP>
    <FP>The United States is committed to working together with the countries of the Western Hemisphere as neighbors and partners to meet our shared challenges of drug trafficking and use. My Administration will seek to expand cooperation with key partners, such as Mexico and Colombia, to shape a collective and comprehensive response and expand efforts to address the production and trafficking of dangerous synthetic drugs that are responsible for many of our overdose deaths, particularly fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and methamphetamine. In Mexico, we must continue to work together to intensify efforts to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and their networks, increase prosecutions of criminal leaders and facilitators, and strengthen efforts to seize illicit assets. In Bolivia, I encourage the government to take additional steps to safeguard the country's licit coca markets from criminal exploitation and reduce illicit coca cultivation that continues to exceed legal limits under Bolivia's domestic laws for medicinal and traditional use. In addition, the United States will look to expand cooperation with China, India, and other chemical source countries in order to disrupt the global flow of synthetic drugs and their precursor chemicals.</FP>

        <E T="03">Policy.</E>
         In the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 U.S.C. 2107 note) (the “Act”), the Congress declared that “all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . . . should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination.” The Congress also found that “most of the records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.” Almost 30 years since the Act, the profound national tragedy of President Kennedy's assassination continues to resonate in American history and in the memories of so many Americans who were alive on that terrible day; meanwhile, the need to protect records concerning the assassination has only grown weaker with the passage of time. It is therefore critical to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, disclosing all information in records concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise.

        <E T="03">Background.</E>
         The Act permits the continued postponement of disclosure of information in records concerning President Kennedy's assassination only when postponement remains necessary to protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Since 2018, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have been reviewing under this statutory standard each redaction they have proposed that would result in the continued postponement of full public disclosure. This year, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has been reviewing whether it agrees that each redaction continues to meet the statutory standard. The Archivist of the United States (Archivist), however, has reported that “unfortunately, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the agencies” and NARA and that NARA “require[s] additional time to engage with the agencies and to conduct research within the larger collection to maximize the amount of information released.” The Archivist has also noted that “making these decisions is a matter that requires a professional, scholarly, and orderly process; not decisions or releases made in haste.” The Archivist therefore recommends that the President “temporarily certify the continued withholding of all of the information certified in 2018” and “direct two 
        <PRTPAGE P="817"/>
        public releases of the information that has” ultimately “been determined to be appropriate for release to the public,” with one interim release later this year and one more comprehensive release in late 2022.

        <E T="03">Temporary Certification.</E>
         In light of the agencies' proposals for continued postponement under the statutory standard, the Archivist's request for an extension of time to engage with the agencies, and the need for an appropriate review and disclosure process, I agree with the Archivist's recommendation. Temporary continued postponement is necessary to protect against identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 5(g)(2)(D) of the Act, I hereby certify that all information within records that agencies have proposed for continued postponement under section 5(g)(2)(D) shall be withheld from full public disclosure until December 15, 2022.

        <E T="03">Interim Release.</E>
         Any information currently withheld from public disclosure that agencies have not proposed for continued postponement shall be reviewed by NARA before December 15, 2021, and shall be publicly released on that date. Out of respect for the anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination, such release shall not occur before December 15, 2021.

        <E T="03">Intensive 1-Year Review.</E>
         (a) Over the next year, agencies proposing continued postponement and NARA shall conduct an intensive review of each remaining redaction to ensure that the United States Government maximizes transparency, disclosing all information in records concerning the assassination, except when the strongest possible reasons counsel otherwise. This review shall include documents within the assassination records collection designated as “not believed relevant” by the Assassination Records Review Board established under the Act, but nonetheless placed within the collection by the Assassination Records Review Board.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) Any information that an agency proposes for continued postponement beyond December 15, 2022, shall be limited to the absolute minimum under the statutory standard. An agency shall not propose to continue redacting information unless the redaction is necessary to protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure. In applying this statutory standard, an agency shall:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) Accord substantial weight to the public interest in transparency and full disclosure of any record that falls within the scope of the Act; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) Give due consideration that some degree of harm is not grounds for continued postponement unless the degree of harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest.</FP>
    <P>(c) For any record containing information that an agency proposes for continued postponement beyond December 15, 2022, the agency shall provide, no later than December 15, 2021:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">
        (i) an unclassified letter, to be signed by the head of the agency, providing a written description of the types of information for which the

    </FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) an unclassified index identifying for each such record the reasons for which the agency is proposing continued postponement of information in such record; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) a specific proposed date identifying for each such record when the agency reasonably anticipates that continued postponement of information in such record no longer would be necessary or, if that is not possible, a specific proposed date for each such record identifying when the agency would propose to next review again after December 15, 2022, whether the information proposed for continued postponement in such record still satisfies the statutory standard for postponement.</FP>
    <P>(d) NARA shall review each proposed redaction, no later than September 1, 2022, in consultation with:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) The Department of Defense if the agency proposing the redaction asserts an anticipated harm to the military defense;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence if the agency proposing the redaction asserts an anticipated harm to intelligence operations;</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) The Department of Justice if the agency proposing the redaction asserts an anticipated harm to law enforcement; and</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iv) The Department of State if the agency proposing the redaction asserts an anticipated harm to the conduct of foreign relations.</FP>
    <P>(e) The relevant consulting agency, as designated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall provide its assessment to NARA as to whether the information proposed for continued postponement satisfies the statutory standard for such postponement. In reviewing a proposed redaction, NARA or the relevant consulting agency, as designated pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, should consult with the agency that proposed the redaction.</P>
    <P>(f) If NARA does not agree that a proposed redaction meets the statutory standard for continued postponement, it shall inform the agency that proposed the redaction. After consultation with NARA, the agency that proposed the redaction may, no later than October 1, 2022:</P>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) withdraw the proposed redaction; or</FP>
    <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) refer the decision on continued postponement to the President through the Counsel to the President, accompanied by an explanation of why continued postponement remains necessary to protect against an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.</FP>
    <P>
        (g) If NARA agrees that a proposed redaction meets the asserted statutory standard for continued postponement, the Archivist shall recommend to the President, no later than October 1, 2022, that continued postponement from public disclosure of the information is warranted after December 15, 2022.
        <PRTPAGE P="819"/>
    </P>
    <P>(h) At the conclusion of the 1-year review, any information still withheld from public disclosure that agencies do not propose for continued postponement beyond December 15, 2022, shall be released to the public on that date.</P>
    <P>(i) At the conclusion of the 1-year review, each unclassified letter described in subsection (c)(i) of this section and each unclassified index described in subsection (c)(ii) of this section shall be disclosed to the public on December 15, 2022, with any updates made to account for any information initially proposed for continued postponement that is not postponed from public disclosure beyond December 15, 2022.</P>

         (a) Since the 1990s, more than 250,000 records concerning President Kennedy's assassination—more than 90 percent of NARA's collection—have been released in full to the public. Only a small fraction of the records contains any remaining redactions. But many records that have been fully disclosed are inaccessible to most members of the public unless they travel to NARA's location in College Park, Maryland.
    </FP>
    <P>(b) The Archivist shall issue a plan, no later than December 15, 2021, to digitize and make available online NARA's entire collection of records concerning President Kennedy's assassination.</P>
    <P>(c) The Archivist shall provide additional context online about the records that have been withheld in full under sections 10 and 11 of the Act—primarily documents containing tax-related information of the Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration—that are not subject to the Presidential certification requirement under section 5 of the Act.</P>

    <FP>
        On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability. The President took additional steps to address this national emergency in Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014.

    <FP>The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014, must continue in effect beyond October 27, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared in Executive Order 13413, as amended by Executive Order 13671.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan</HD>
    <FP>On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), and took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, by Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the Darfur region. On October 13, 2006, by Executive Order 13412, the President took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 and expanded in Executive Order 13400. In Executive Order 13412, the President also took steps to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).</FP>
    <FP>On January 13, 2017, by Executive Order 13761, the President found that positive efforts by the Government of Sudan between July 2016 and January 2017 improved certain conditions that Executive Orders 13067 and 13412 were intended to address. Given these developments, and in order to encourage the Government of Sudan to sustain and enhance these efforts, section 1 of Executive Order 13761 provided that sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 would be revoked as of July 12, 2017, provided that the criteria in section 12(b) of Executive Order 13761 had been met.</FP>
    <FP>On July 11, 2017, by Executive Order 13804, the President amended Executive Order 13761, extending until October 12, 2017, the effective date in section 1 of Executive Order 13761. On October 12, 2017, pursuant to Executive Order 13761, as amended by Executive Order 13804, sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 were revoked.</FP>
    <FP>
        Sudan made strides in its transition toward democracy since 2019, but the military takeover of the government and arrest of civilian leaders now threaten those positive gains. The crisis that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997; the expansion of that emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; and the taking of additional steps with respect to that emergency in Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not been resolved. The situation in Darfur continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as expanded by Executive Order 13400, must continue in effect beyond November 3, 2021.

    <FP>
        On November 12, 2020, by Executive Order 13959, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
        ) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
    </FP>
    <FP>The President found that the PRC is increasingly exploiting United States capital to resource and enable the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which continues to allow the PRC to directly threaten the United States homeland and United States forces overseas. Through the national strategy of Military-Civil Fusion, the PRC increases the size of the country's military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities. Those companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the PRC's military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernization. At the same time, those companies raise capital by selling securities to United States investors that trade on public exchanges both here and abroad, lobbying United States index providers and funds to include these securities in market offerings, and engaging in other acts to ensure access to United States capital.</FP>
    <FP>The President further found that the PRC's military-industrial complex, by directly supporting the efforts of the PRC's military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>
        On January 13, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 13974 amending Executive Order 13959.
        <PRTPAGE P="824"/>
    </FP>
    <FP>On June 3, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14032, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959. I found that additional steps are necessary to address that national emergency, including the threat posed by the military-industrial complex of the PRC and its involvement in military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, and weapons and related equipment production under the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion strategy. In addition, I found that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constituted unusual and extraordinary threats to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and I expanded the national emergency to address these threats. Executive Order 14032 amended Executive Order 13959 and revoked Executive Order 13974 in its entirety.</FP>
    <FP>The threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the PRC and certain uses and development of Chinese surveillance technology continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.</FP>
    <FP>For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 of November 12, 2020, expanded in scope by Executive Order 14032 of June 3, 2021, must continue in effect beyond November 12, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 with respect to the threat from securities investments that finance certain companies of the PRC and expanded in Executive Order 14032.</FP>

    <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction</HD>
    <FP>
        On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, by Executive Order 13094, the President amended Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. On June 28, 2005, by Executive Order 13382, the President, among other things, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to combat proliferation. The 
        <PRTPAGE P="826"/>
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, with respect to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons must continue beyond November 14, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.

    <FP>The situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime's systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on November 27, 2018, must continue in effect beyond November 27, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 with respect to the situation in Nicaragua.</FP>

In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 102.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result

                    in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

                    <E T="03">General.</E>
                     The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

                     In meeting the requirements of § 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
                </P>
                <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
                <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>

                     In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
                </P>
                <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
                <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
                <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
