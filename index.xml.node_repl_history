      <description>The CISCO Networking Academy: CCNA program teaches comprehensive networking concepts,
         from CISCO network applications to the protocols and services provided to those applications
         by the lower layers of the network. Students will progress from basic networking to
         more complex enterprise and theoretical networking models later in the curriculum.
         In each course, students will learn technical concepts with the support of interactive
         media and apply this knowledge through a series of hands-on and simulated activities
         that reinforce learning. The courses serve as preparation to take the Cisco Certified
         Entry Networking Technician (CCENT®) certification exam after completing the first
         two courses and the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA®) Routing and Switching
         certification exam after completing all four courses.

         Some common clinical tasks include taking vital signs, performing basic laboratory
         tests, disposing of or sterilizing laboratory supplies, drawing blood or preparing
         patients for physicians. Common administrative tasks include appointment scheduling,
         insurance verifications, medical records and billing and coding.

         is a health profession concerned with promoting the quality of life of individuals

      <description>Being a paramedic, or an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), is not only a great way
         to make a positive change in the world, but it is a fulfilling career choice that
         presents a different set of challenges everyday. Paramedics are needed in every region—
         urban and rural. Paramedics are the first on the scene of any emergency and are trained
         to work quickly and efficiently, making rapid decisions based on solid training. Paramedics
         assess medical situations, stabilize and treat patients until they are safely transported
         to a medical facility.

         years towards a bachelor's degree in education. The AAT degree can then transfer to
         one of Missouri's four-year teaching colleges or universities where students can complete
         the bachelor's degree in teaching. The courses in this program meet teacher certification
         requirements, are fully accredited by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary
         Education and are fully transferable to many Missouri four-year colleges.
